  <h2 class='c008'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The object of the present work is the publication of researches
which I have been carrying on for more than
four years on radio-active bodies. I began these researches
by a study of the phosphorescence of uranium, discovered
by M. Becquerel. The results to which I was led by this
work promised to afford so interesting a field that M. Curie
put aside the work on which he was engaged, and joined
me, our object being the extraction of new radio-active
substances and the further study of their properties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the commencement of our research we thought it
well to hand over specimens of the substances, discovered
and prepared by ourselves, to certain physicists, in the first
place to M. Becquerel, to whom is due the discovery of the
uranium rays. In this way we ourselves facilitated the
research by others besides ourselves on the new radio-active
bodies. At the termination of our first publications, M.
Giesel, in Germany, also began to prepare these substances,
and passed on specimens of them to several German
scientists. Finally, these substances were placed on sale in
France and Germany, and the subject growing in importance
gave rise to a scientific movement, such that numerous
memoirs have appeared, and are constantly appearing on
radio-active bodies, principally abroad. The results of the
various French and foreign researches are necessarily confused,
as is the case with all new subjects in course of
investigation, the aspect of the question becoming modified
from day to day.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the chemical point of view, however, one point is
definitely established:—<i>i.e.</i>, the existence of a new element,
strongly radio-active, viz., radium. The preparation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>pure chloride of radium and the determination of the atomic
weight of radium form the chief part of my own work.
Whilst this work adds to the elements actually known with
certainty a new element with very curious properties, a new
method of chemical research is at the same time established
and justified. This method, based on the consideration of
radio-activity as an atomic property of matter, is just that
which enabled M. Curie and myself to discover the existence
of radium.</p>

<p class='c010'>If, from the chemical point of view, the question that we
undertook primarily may be looked upon as solved, the
study of the physical properties of the radio-active bodies is
in full evolution. Certain important points have been
established, but a large number of the conclusions are still
of a provisional character. This is not surprising when we
consider the complexity of the phenomena due to radio-activity,
and the differences existing between the various
radio-active substances. The researches of physicists on
these substances constantly meet and overlap. Whilst
endeavouring to keep strictly to the limits of this work and
to publish my individual research only, I have been obliged
at the same time to mention results of other researches, the
knowledge of which is indispensable.</p>

<p class='c010'>I desired, moreover, to make this work an inclusive
survey of the actual position of the question.</p>

<p class='c010'>I indicate at the end the particular questions with which
I am specially concerned, and those which I investigated in
conjunction with M. Curie.</p>

<p class='c010'>I carried on the work in the laboratories of the School of
Physics and Chemistry in Paris, with the permission of
Schützenberger, late Director of the School, and M. Lauth,
actual Director. I take this opportunity of expressing my
gratitude for the kind hospitality received in this school.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Historical.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The discovery of the phenomena of radio-activity is connected
with researches followed, since the discovery of the
Röntgen rays, upon the photographic effects of phosphorescent
and fluorescent substances.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first tubes for producing Röntgen rays were without
the metallic anticathode. The source of the Röntgen rays
was the glass surface impinged upon by the cathode rays;
this surface was at the same time actively fluorescent. The
question then was whether the emission of Röntgen rays
necessarily accompanied the production of fluorescence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>whatever might be the cause of the latter. This idea was
first enunciated by M. Henri Poincaré.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shortly afterwards, M. Henry announced that he had
obtained photographic impressions through black paper by
means of phosphorescent zinc sulphide. M. Niewenglowski
obtained the same phenomenon with calcium sulphide exposed
to the light. Finally, M. Troost obtained strong
photographic impressions with zinc sulphide artificially
phosphorescent acting across black paper and thick cardboard.</p>

<p class='c010'>The experiences just cited have not been reproduced, in
spite of numerous attempts to this end. It cannot therefore
be considered as proved that zinc sulphide and calcium
sulphide are capable of emitting, under the action of light,
invisible rays which traverse black paper and act on photographic
plates.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Becquerel has made similar experiments on the salts
of uranium, some of which are fluorescent.</p>

<p class='c010'>He obtained photographic impressions through black
paper with the double sulphate of uranium and potassium.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Becquerel at first believed that this salt, which is
fluorescent, behaved like the sulphides of zinc and calcium
in the experiments of MM. Henry, Niewenglowski, and
Troost. But the conclusion of his experiments showed
that the phenomenon observed was in no way related to
the fluorescence. It is not necessary that the salt should
be fluorescent; further, uranium and all its compounds,
fluorescent or not, act in the same manner, and metallic
uranium is the most active. M. Becquerel finally found
that by placing uranium compounds in complete darkness,
they continue acting on photographic plates through black
paper for years. M. Becquerel allows that uranium and
its compounds emit peculiar rays—uranium rays. He
proved that these rays can penetrate thin metallic screens,
and that they discharge electrified bodies. He also made
experiments from which he concluded that uranium rays
undergo reflection, refraction, and polarisation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The work of other physicists (Elster and Geitel, Lord
Kelvin, Schmidt, Rutherford, Beattie, and Smoluchowski)
confirms and extends the results of the researches of M.
Becquerel, with the exception of those relating to the reflection,
refraction, and polarisation of uranium rays, which
in this respect behave like Röntgen rays, as has been recognised
first by Mr. Rutherford and then by M. Becquerel
himself.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Becquerel Rays.</i>—The uranium rays discovered by M.
Becquerel act upon photographic plates screened from the
light; they can penetrate all solid, liquid, and gaseous substances,
provided that the thickness is sufficiently reduced;
in passing through a gas, they cause it to become a feeble
conductor of electricity.</p>

<p class='c010'>These properties of the uranium compounds are not due
to any known cause. The radiation seems to be spontaneous;
it loses nothing in intensity, even on keeping the
compounds in complete darkness for several years; hence
there is no question of the phosphorescence being specially
produced by light.</p>

<p class='c010'>The spontaneity and persistence of the uranium radiation
appear as a quite unique physical phenomenon. M.
Becquerel kept a piece of uranium for several years in the
dark, and he has affirmed that at the end of this time the
action upon a photographic plate had not sensibly altered.
MM. Elster and Geitel made a similar experiment, and also
found the action to remain constant.</p>

<p class='c010'>I measured the intensity of radiation of uranium by the
effect of this radiation on the conductivity of air. The
method of measurement will be explained later. I also
obtained figures which prove the persistence of radiation
within the limits of accuracy of the experiments.</p>

<p class='c010'>For these measurements a metallic plate was used
covered with a layer of powdered uranium; this plate was
not otherwise kept in the dark; this precaution, according
to the experimenters already quoted, being of no importance.
The number of measurements taken with this plate is
very great, and they actually extend over a period of five
years.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some researches were conducted to discover whether
other substances were capable of acting similarly to the
uranium compounds. M. Schmidt was the first to publish
that thorium and its compounds possess exactly the same
property. A similar research, made contemporaneously,
gave me the same result. I published this not knowing at
the time of Schmidt’s publication.</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall say that uranium, thorium, and their compounds
emit <i>Becquerel rays</i>. I have called <i>radio-active</i>
those substances which generate emissions of this nature.
This name has since been adopted generally.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>In their photographic and electric effects, the Becquerel
rays approximate to the Röntgen rays. They also, like the
latter, possess the faculty of penetrating all matter. But
their capacity for penetration is very different; the rays of
uranium and of thorium are arrested by some millimetres of
solid matter, and cannot traverse in air a distance greater
than a few centimetres; this at least is the case for the
greater part of the radiation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The researches of different physicists, and primarily of
Mr. Rutherford, have shown that the Becquerel rays
undergo neither regular reflection, nor refraction, nor
polarisation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The feeble penetrating power of uranium and thorium
rays would point to their similarity to the secondary rays
produced by the Röntgen rays, and which have been investigated
by M. Sagnac, rather than to the Röntgen rays
themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the rest, the Becquerel rays might be classified as
cathode rays propagated in the air. It is now known that
these different analogies are all legitimate.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 1.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The method employed consists in measuring the conductivity
acquired by air under the action of radio-active
bodies; this method possesses the advantage of being rapid
and of furnishing
figures which are
comparable. The apparatus
employed by
me for the purpose
consists essentially of
a plate condenser,
<span class='fss'>A B</span> (Fig. 1). The
active body, finely
powered, is spread
over the plate <span class='fss'>B</span>,
making the air between
the plates a
conductor. In order
to measure the conductivity,
the plate <span class='fss'>B</span>
is raised to a high potential by connecting it with one pole of
a battery of small accumulators, <span class='fss'>P</span>, of which the other pole is
connected to earth. The plate <span class='fss'>A</span> being maintained at the
potential of the earth by the connection <span class='fss'>C D</span>, an electric current
is set up between the two plates. The potential of plate <span class='fss'>A</span> is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>recorded by an electrometer, <span class='fss'>E</span>. If the earth connection be
broken at <span class='fss'>C</span>, the plate <span class='fss'>A</span> becomes charged, and this charge
causes a deflection of the electrometer. The velocity of
the deflection is proportional to the intensity of the current,
and serves to measure the latter.</p>

<p class='c010'>But a preferable method of measurement is that of compensating
the charge on plate <span class='fss'>A</span>, so as to cause no deflection
of the electrometer. The charges in question are
extremely weak; they may be compensated by means of a
quartz electric balance, <span class='fss'>Q</span>, one sheath of which is connected
to plate <span class='fss'>A</span> and the other to earth. The quartz lamina is
subjected to a known tension, produced by placing weights
in a plate, π; the tension is produced progressively, and
has the effect of generating progressively a known quantity
of electricity during the time observed. The operation can
be so regulated that, at each instant, there is compensation
between the quantity of electricity that traverses the condenser
and that of the opposite kind furnished by the
quartz. In this way, the quantity of electricity passing
through the condenser for a given time, <i>i.e.</i>, the <i>intensity
of the current</i>, can be measured <i>in absolute units</i>. The
measurement is independent of the sensitiveness of the
electrometer.</p>

<p class='c010'>In carrying out a certain number of measurements of this
kind, it is seen that radio-activity is a phenomenon capable
of being measured with a certain accuracy. It varies little
with temperature; it is scarcely affected by variations in
the temperature of the surroundings; it is not influenced
by incandescence of the active substance. The intensity
of the current which traverses the condenser increases with
the surface of the plates. For a given condenser and a
given substance the current increases with the difference
of potential between the plates, with the pressure of the gas
which fills the condenser, and with the distance of the plates
(provided this distance be not too great in comparison with
the diameter). In every case, for great differences of
potential the current attains a limiting value, which is
practically constant. This is the <i>current of saturation</i>, or
<i>limiting current</i>. Similarly, for a certain sufficiently great
distance between the plates the current hardly varies any
longer with the distance. It is the current obtained under
these conditions that was taken as the measure of radio-activity
in my researches, the condenser being placed in air
at atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p class='c010'>I append curves which represent the intensity of the
current as a function of the field established between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>plates for two different plate distances. Plate <span class='fss'>B</span> was
covered with a thin layer of powdered metallic uranium;
plate <span class='fss'>A</span>, connected with the electrometer, was provided with
a guard-ring.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 3.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Fig. 2 shows that the intensity of the current becomes
constant for high potential differences between the plates.
Fig. 3 represents the same curves on another scale, and
comprehends only relative results for small differences of
potential. At the origin, the curve is rectilinear; the
ratio of the intensity of the current to the difference of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>potential is constant for weak forces, and represents the
initial conduction between the plates. Two important
characteristic constants of the observed phenomenon are
therefore to be recognised:—(1) The <i>initial conduction</i> for
small differences of potential; (2) the <i>limiting current</i> for
great potential differences. The limiting current has been
adopted as the measure of the radio-activity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides the difference of potential established between
the two plates, there exists between them an electromotive
force of contact, and these two sources of current
combine their effects; for this reason, the absolute value of
the intensity of the current changes with the sign of the
external difference of potential. In every case, for considerable
potential differences, the effect of the electromotive
force of contact is negligible, and the intensity of
the current is therefore the same whatever be the direction
of the field between the plates.</p>

<p class='c010'>The investigation of the conductivity of air and other
gases subjected to the action of Becquerel rays has been
undertaken by several physicists. A very complete research
upon the subject has been published by Mr.
Rutherford.</p>

<p class='c010'>The laws of the conductivity produced in gases by the
Becquerel rays are the same as those found for the
Röntgen rays. The mechanics of the phenomenon appear
to be the same in both cases. The theory of ionisation of
the gases by the action of the Röntgen or Becquerel rays
agrees well with the observed facts. This theory will not
be put forward here. I will merely record the results to
which they point:—</p>

<p class='c010'>Firstly, the number of ions produced per second in the
gas is considered proportional to the energy of radiation
absorbed by the gas.</p>

<p class='c010'>Secondly, in order to obtain the limiting current relatively
to a given radiation, it is necessary, on the one
hand, to cause complete absorption of this radiation by the
gas by employing a sufficient mass of it; on the other
hand, it is necessary for the production of the current to
use all the ions generated by establishing an electric field of
such strength that the number of the ions which recombine
may be a negligible fraction of the total number of ions
produced in the same time, most of which are carried by
the current to the electrodes. The strength of the electric
field necessary to give this result is proportional to the
amount of ionisation.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to the recent researches of Mr. Townsend, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>phenomenon is more complex when the pressure of the gas
is low. At first the current appears to approach to a
constant limiting value with increasing difference of
potential; but after a certain point has been reached, the
current begins again to increase with the field, and with
very great rapidity. Mr. Townsend ascribes this increase
to a new ionisation produced by the ions themselves when,
under the action of the electric field, they acquire a velocity
such that a molecule of gas encountering one of them becomes
broken down into its constituent ions. A strong
electric field and a low pressure are favourable to the production
of this ionisation by ions already present, and, as
soon as the action is set up, the intensity of the current increases
uniformly with the field between the plates. The
limiting current could, therefore, only be obtained under
conditions of ionisation of which the intensity does not
exceed a certain value, and in such a manner that saturation
corresponds to fields in which, from multiplicity of ions,
ionisation can no longer take place. This condition has
occurred in my experiments.</p>

<p class='c010'>The order of magnitude of the saturation currents
obtained with uranium compounds is 10<sup>–11</sup> ampères for a
condenser in which the plates have a diameter of 8 c.m.,
and are at a distance of 3 c.m. Thorium compounds give
rise to currents of the same order of magnitude, and the
activity of the oxides of uranium and thorium is very
similar.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Radio-activity of the Compounds of Uranium and Thorium.</i></h3>

uranium compounds. I have represented the intensity of
the current in ampères by the letter <i>i</i>:—</p>

<p class='c010'>The characteristics of the thorium radiation have formed
the subject of very complete publications. Mr. Owens has
demonstrated that a uniform current is only obtained after
some time has elapsed, with an enclosed apparatus, and
that the intensity of the current is greatly reduced under
the influence of a current of air (which does not occur with
the compounds of uranium). Mr. Rutherford has made
similar experiments, and has explained them by the proposition
that thorium and its compounds produce, besides
the Becquerel rays, another <i>emanation</i>, composed of
extremely minute particles, which remain radio-active for
some time after their emission, and are capable of being
swept along by a current of air.</p>

<p class='c010'>The characteristics of the thorium radiation, which have
reference to the thickness of the layer employed and to the
action of air currents, have an intimate connection with the
phenomenon of the <i>radio-activity induced, and of its propagation
from place to place</i>. This phenomenon was observed
for the first time with radium, and will be described later.</p>

<p class='c010'>The radio-activity of thorium and uranium compounds
appears as an <i>atomic property</i>. M. Becquerel has already
observed that all uranium compounds are active, and had
concluded that their activity was due to the presence of the
element uranium; he also demonstrated that uranium
was more active than its salts. I have investigated, from
this point of view, the compounds of thorium and uranium,
and have taken a great many measurements of their
activity under different conditions. The result of all these
determinations shows the radio-activity of these substances
to be decidedly an atomic property. It seems to depend
upon the presence of atoms of the two elements in question,
and is not influenced by any change of physical state or
chemical decomposition. The chemical combinations and
mixtures containing uranium or thorium are active in proportion

<h3 class='c011'><i>Is Atomic Radio-activity a general Phenomenon?</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>As I have said above, I made experiments to discover
whether substances other than compounds of uranium and
thorium were radio-active. I undertook this research with
the idea that it was scarcely probable that radio-activity,
considered as an atomic property, should belong to a
certain kind of matter to the exclusion of all other. The
determinations I made permit me to say that, for chemical
elements actually considered as such, including the rarest
and most hypothetical, the compounds I investigated were
always at least 100 times less active in my apparatus than
metallic uranium.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following is a summary of the substances experimented
upon, either as the element or in combination:—</p>

<p class='c010'>1. All the metals or non-metals easily procurable, and
some, more rare, pure products obtained from the collection
of M. Etard, at the Ecole de Physique et de Chimie
Industrielles de la Ville de Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. The following rare bodies:—Gallium, germanium,
neodymium, praseodymium, niobium, scandium, gadolinium,
erbium, samarium, and rubidium (specimens lent by
M. Demarçay), yttrium, ytterbium (lent by M. Urbain).</p>

<p class='c010'>3. A large number of rocks and minerals.</p>

<p class='c010'>Within the limits of sensitiveness of any apparatus, I
found no simple substance, other than uranium and
thorium, possessing atomic radio-activity. It will be
suitable to add a few words here concerning phosphorus.
White moist phosphorus, placed between the plates of the
condenser, causes the air between the plates to conduct.
However, I do not consider this body radio-active in the
same manner as thorium and uranium. For, under these
conditions, phosphorus becomes oxidised and emits
luminous rays, whilst uranium and thorium compounds are
radio-active without showing any chemical change which can
be detected by any known means. Further, phosphorus is
not active in the red variety, nor in a state of combination.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a recent work, M. Bloch has demonstrated that phosphorus,
undergoing oxidation in air, gives rise to slightly
motile ions, which make the air conduct, and cause condensation
of aqueous vapour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Uranium and thorium are elements which possess the
highest atomic weights (240 and 232); they occur frequently
in the same minerals.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have examined many minerals in my apparatus; certain
of them gave evidence of radio-activity, <i>e.g.</i>, pitchblende,
thorite, orangite, fergusonite, cleveite, chalcolite, autunite,
monazite, &amp;c. The following is a table giving in ampères

<p class='c010'>The current obtained with orangite (native oxide of
thorium) varied greatly with the thickness of the layer. By
increasing this thickness from 0·25 m.m. to 6 m.m. the
current increased from 1·8 to 2·3.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the minerals which showed radio-activity contained
uranium or thorium: their activity is therefore not surprising,
but the intensity of the action in certain cases is
unexpected. Thus pitchblendes (ores of uranium oxide) are
found which are four times as active as metallic uranium.
Chalcolite (double phosphate of copper and uranium) is
twice as active as uranium. Autunite (phosphate of
uranium and calcium) is as active as uranium. These
facts do not accord with previous conclusions, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>to which no mineral should be so active as thorium or
uranium.</p>

<p class='c010'>To throw light on this point, I prepared artificial
chalcolite by the process of Debray, starting with the pure
products. The process consists in mixing a solution of
uranium nitrate with a solution of copper phosphate in
phosphoric acid and warming to 50° or 60°. After some
time, crystals of chalcolite appear in the liquid.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chalcolite thus obtained possesses a perfectly normal
activity, given by its composition; it is two and a-half times
less active than uranium.</p>

<p class='c010'>It therefore appeared probable that if pitchblende,
chalcolite, and autunite possess so great a degree of
activity, these substances contain a small quantity of a
strongly radio-active body, differing from uranium and
thorium and the simple bodies actually known. I thought
that if this were indeed the case, I might hope to extract
this substance from the ore by the ordinary methods of
chemical analysis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Method of Research.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The results of the investigation of radio-active minerals,
announced in the preceding chapter, led M. Curie and myself
to endeavour to extract a new radio-active body from pitchblende.
Our method of procedure could only be based on
radio-activity, as we know of no other property of the hypothetical
substance. The following is the method pursued
for a research based on radio-activity:—The radio-activity
of a compound is determined, and a chemical decomposition
of this compound is effected; the radio-activity of all the
products obtained is determined, having regard to the proportion
in which the radio-active substance is distributed
among them. In this way, an indication is obtained, which
may to a certain extent be compared to that which spectrum
analysis furnishes. In order to obtain comparable figures,
the activity of the substances must be determined in the
solid form well dried.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Polonium, Radium, Actinium.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The analysis of pitchblende with the help of the method
just explained, led us to the discovery in this mineral of two
strongly radio-active substances, chemically dissimilar:—Polonium,
discovered by ourselves, and radium, which we
discovered in conjunction with M. Bémont.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span><i>Polonium</i> from the analytical point of view, is analogous
to bismuth, and separates out with the latter. By one of
the following methods of fractionating, bismuth products
are obtained increasingly rich in polonium:—</p>

<p class='c010'>1. Sublimation of the sulphides <i>in vacuo</i>; the active sulphide
is much more volatile than bismuth sulphide.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. Precipitation of solutions of the nitrate by water; the
precipitate of the basic nitrate is much more active than the
salt which remains in solution.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Precipitation by sulphuretted hydrogen of a hydrochloric
acid solution, strongly acid; the precipitated sulphides
are considerably more active than the salt which
remains in solution.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Radium</i> is a substance which accompanies the barium
obtained from pitchblende; it resembles barium in its reactions,
and is separated from it by difference of solubility
of the chlorides in water, in dilute alcohol, or in water
acidified with hydrochloric acid. We effect the separation
of the chlorides of barium and radium by subjecting the mixture
to fractional crystallisation, radium chloride being less
soluble than that of barium.</p>

<p class='c010'>A third strongly radio-active body has been identified in
pitchblende by M. Debierne, who gave it the name of
<i>actinium</i>. Actinium accompanies certain members of the
iron group contained in pitchblende; it appears in particular
allied to thorium, from which it has not yet been found
possible to separate it. The extraction of actinium from
pitchblende is a very difficult operation, the separations
being as a rule incomplete.</p>

<p class='c010'>All three of the new radio-active bodies occur in quite
infinitesimal amount in pitchblende. In order to obtain
them in a more concentrated condition, we were obliged to
treat several tons of residue of the ore of uranium. The
rough treatment was carried out in the factory; and this
was followed by processes of purification and concentration.
We thus succeeded in extracting from thousands of kilogrms.
of crude material a few decigrammes of products which
were exceedingly active as compared with the ore from which
they were obtained. It is obvious that this process is long,
arduous, and costly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other new radio-active bodies have been notified since the
termination of our work. M. Giesel, on the one hand, and
MM. Hoffmann and Strauss on the other, have announced
the probable existence of a radio-active body similar to lead
in its chemical properties. At present only a few samples
of this substance have been obtained.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Radium is, so far, the only member of the new radio-active
substances that has been isolated as the pure salt.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Spectrum of Radium.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>It was of the first importance to check, by all possible
means, the hypothesis, underlying this work, of new radio-active
elements. In the case of radium, spectrum analysis
was the means of confirming this hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Demarçay undertook the examination of the new radio-active
bodies by the searching methods which he employs in
the study of photographic spark spectra.</p>

<p class='c010'>The assistance of so competent a scientist was of the
greatest value to us, and we are deeply grateful to him for
having consented to take up this work. The results of the
spectrum analysis brought conviction to us when we were
still in doubt as to the interpretation of the results of our
research.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first specimens of fairly active barium chloride containing
radium, examined by M. Demarçay, exhibited
together with the barium lines a new line of considerable intensity
and of wave-length λ = 381·47 µµ in the ultra-violet.
With the more active products prepared subsequently, Demarçay
saw the line 381·47 µµ more distinctly; at the same
time other new lines appeared, and the intensity of the new
lines was comparable with that of the barium lines. A further
concentration furnished a product for which the new spectrum
predominated, and the three strongest barium lines,
alone visible, merely indicated the presence of this metal as
an impurity. This product may be looked upon as nearly
pure radium chloride. Finally, by further purification, I
obtained an exceedingly pure chloride, in the spectrum of
which the two chief barium lines were scarcely visible.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following is a list, according to Demarçay, of the
principal radium lines for the portion of the spectrum included
between λ = 500·0 and λ = 350·0 µµ. The intensity
of each line is represented by a figure, the strongest being
marked 16:—</p>

<p class='c010'>All the lines are clear and narrow, the three lines 381·47,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>468·30, 434·06 are strong, and equal the most intense of
those actually known. Two well-marked misty bands are
also visible in the spectrum. The first, which is symmetrical,
extends from 463·10 to 462·19, with a maximum
at 462·75. The second, which is stronger, fades towards
the ultra-violet; it begins, sharply defined, at 446·37, and
passes through a maximum at 445·52; the region of the
maximum extends as far as 445·34, then a nebulous band,
gradually fading, extends about as far as 439.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the least refrangible part, not photographed in the
spark spectrum, the only significant line is 566·5 (approx.),
much more feeble, however, than 482·63.</p>

<p class='c010'>The general aspect of the spectrum is that of the metals
of the alkaline earths; these metals are known to have
well-marked line spectra with certain nebulous bands.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to Demarçay, the position of radium may
be among the bodies possessing the most sensitive spectrum
reaction. I also have concluded from the work of concentration,
that in the first specimen examined, which showed
clearly the line 3814·7, the proportion of radium must have
been very small (perhaps about 0·02 per cent). Nevertheless,
an activity fifty times as great as that of metallic uranium
is required in order to distinguish clearly the principal
radium line in the spectra photographed. With a sensitive
electrometer the radio-activity of a substance only 1/100
of that of metallic uranium can be detected. It is clear
that, in order to detect the presence of radium, the property
of radio-activity is several thousand times more sensitive
than the spectrum reaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bismuth containing polonium and thorium containing
actinium, both very active, examined by Demarçay, have so
far each only yielded bismuth and thorium lines.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a recent publication, M. Giesel, who is occupied in
preparing radium, states that radium bromide gives a
carmine flame colouration. The flame spectrum of radium
contains two beautiful red bands, one line in the blue-green,
and two faint lines in the violet.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Extraction of the New Radio-active Substances.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The first stage of the operation consists in extracting
barium with radium from the ores of uranium, also bismuth
with polonium and the rare earths containing actinium
from the same. These three primary products having been
obtained, the next step is in each case to endeavour to
isolate the new radio-active body. This second part of the
treatment consists of a process of fractionation. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>difficulty of finding a very perfect means of separating
closely allied elements is well known; methods of fractionation
are therefore quite suitable. Besides this, when a
mere trace of one element is mixed with another element,
no method of complete separation could be applied to the
mixture, even allowing that such a method was known; in
fact, one would run the risk of losing the trace of the
material to be separated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The particular object of my work has been the isolation
of radium and polonium. After working for several years,
I have so far only succeeded in obtaining the former.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pitchblende is an expensive ore, and we have given up
the treatment of it in large quantities. In Europe the
extraction of this ore is carried out in the mine of
Joachimsthal, in Bohemia. The crushed ore is roasted with
carbonate of soda, and the resulting material washed, first
with warm water and then with dilute sulphuric acid. The
solution contains the uranium, which gives pitchblende its
value. The insoluble residue is rejected. This residue
contains radio-active substances; its activity is four and a-half
times that of metallic uranium. The Austrian Government,
to whom the mine belongs, presented us with a ton
of this residue for our research, and authorised the mine to
give us several tons more of the material.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not very easy to apply the methods of the
laboratory to the preliminary treatment of the residue in
the factory. M. Debierne investigated this question, and
organised the treatment in the factory. The most important
point of his method is the conversion of the sulphates
into carbonate by boiling the material with a
concentrated solution of sodium carbonate. This method
avoids the necessity of fusing with sodium carbonate.</p>

<p class='c010'>The residue chiefly contains the sulphates of lead and
calcium, silica, alumina, and iron oxide. In addition
nearly all the metals are found in greater or smaller
amount (copper, bismuth, zinc, cobalt, manganese, nickel,
vanadium, antimony, thallium, rare earths, niobium,
tantalum, arsenic, barium, &amp;c.). Radium is found in this
mixture as sulphate, and is the least soluble sulphate in it.
In order to dissolve it, it is necessary to remove the
sulphuric acid as far as possible. To do this, the residue is
first treated with a boiling concentrated soda solution.
The sulphuric acid combined with the lead, aluminium,
and calcium passes, for the most part, into solution as sulphate
of sodium, which is removed by repeatedly washing
with water. The alkaline solution removes at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>time lead, silicon, and aluminium. The insoluble portion
is attacked by ordinary hydrochloric acid. This operation
completely disintegrates the material, and dissolves most
of it. Polonium and actinium may be obtained from this
solution; the former is precipitated by sulphuretted
hydrogen, the latter is found in the hydrates precipitated by
ammonia in the solution separated from the sulphides and
oxidised. Radium remains in the insoluble portion. This
portion is washed with water, and then treated with a
boiling concentrated solution of carbonate of soda. This
operation completes the transformation of the sulphates of
barium and radium into carbonates. The material is  then
thoroughly washed with water, and then treated with dilute
hydrochloric acid, quite free from sulphuric acid. The
solution contains radium as well as polonium and actinium.
It is filtered and precipitated with sulphuric acid. In this
way the crude sulphates of barium containing radium and
calcium, of lead, and of iron, and of a trace of actinium are
obtained. The solution still contains a little actinium and
polonium, which may be separated out as in the case of the
first hydrochloric acid solution.</p>

<p class='c010'>From one ton of residue 10 to 20 kilogrms. of crude sulphates
are obtained, the activity of which is from thirty to
sixty times as great as that of metallic uranium. They
must now be purified. For this purpose they are boiled
with sodium carbonate and transformed into the chlorides.
The solution is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, which
gives a small quantity of active sulphides containing
polonium. The solution is filtered, oxidised by means of
chlorine, and precipitated with pure ammonia. The precipitated
hydrates and oxides are very active, and the
activity is due to actinium. The filtered solution is precipitated
with sodium carbonate. The precipitated carbonates
of the alkaline earths are washed and converted
into chlorides. These chlorides are evaporated to dryness,
and washed with pure concentrated hydrochloric acid.
Calcium chloride dissolves almost entirely, whilst the
chloride of barium and radium remains insoluble. Thus,
from one ton of the original material about 8 kilogrms. of
barium and radium chloride are obtained, of which the
activity is about sixty times that of metallic uranium. The
chloride is now ready for fractionation.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Polonium.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>As I said above, by passing sulphuretted hydrogen
through the various hydrochloric acid solutions obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>during the course of the process, active sulphides are precipitated,
of which the activity is due to polonium. These
sulphides chiefly contain bismuth, a little copper and lead;
the latter metal occurs in relatively small amount, because
it has been to a great extent removed by the soda solution,
and because its chloride is only slightly soluble. Antimony
and arsenic are found among the oxides only in the
minutest quantity, their oxides having been dissolved by
the soda. In order to obtain the very active sulphides, the
following process was employed:—The solutions made
strongly acid with hydrochloric acid were precipitated with
sulphuretted hydrogen; the sulphides thus precipitated are
very active, and are employed for the preparation of
polonium; there remain in the solution substances not
completely precipitated in presence of excess of hydrochloric
acid (bismuth, lead, antimony). To complete the
precipitation, the solution is diluted with water, and
treated again with sulphuretted hydrogen, which gives a
second precipitate of sulphides, much less active than the
first, and which have generally been rejected. For the
further purification of the sulphides, they are washed with
ammonium sulphide, which removes the last remaining
traces of antimony and arsenic. They are then washed
with water and ammonium nitrate, and treated with dilute
nitric acid. Complete solution never occurs; there is
always an insoluble residue, more or less considerable,
which can be treated afresh if it is judged expedient. The
solution is reduced to a small volume and precipitated
either by ammonia or by excess of water. In both cases
the lead and the copper remain in solution; in the second
case, a little bismuth, scarcely active at all, remains also in
solution.</p>

<p class='c010'>The precipitate of oxides or basic nitrates is subjected to
fractionation in the following manner:—The precipitate is
dissolved in nitric acid, and water is added to the solution
until a sufficient quantity of precipitate is formed; it must
be borne in mind that sometimes the precipitate does not
at once appear. The precipitate is separated from the
supernatant liquid, and re-dissolved in nitric acid, after
which both the liquids thus obtained are re-precipitated
with water, and treated as before. The different fractions
are combined according to their activity, and concentration
is carried out as far as possible. In this way is obtained a
very small quantity of a substance of which the activity is
very high, but which, nevertheless, has so far only shown
bismuth lines in the spectroscope.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>There is, unfortunately, little chance of obtaining the
isolation of polonium by this means. The method of
fractionation just described presents many difficulties, and
the case is similar with other wet processes of fractionation.
Whatever be the method employed, compounds are
readily formed which are absolutely insoluble in dilute or
concentrated acids. These compounds can only be re-dissolved
by reducing them to the metallic state, <i>e.g.</i>, by
fusion with potassium cyanide. Considering the number
of operations necessary, this circumstance constitutes an
enormous difficulty in the progress of the fractionation.
This obstacle is the greater because polonium, once extracted
from the pitchblende, diminishes in activity. This
diminution of activity is slow, for a specimen of bismuth
nitrate containing polonium only lost half its activity in
eleven months.</p>

<p class='c010'>No such difficulty occurs with radium. The radio-activity
remains throughout an accurate gauge of the concentration;
the concentration itself presents no difficulty,
and the progress of the work from the start can be constantly
checked by spectral analysis.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the phenomena of induced radio-activity, which
will be discussed later on, were made known, it seemed
obvious that polonium, which only shows the bismuth
lines and whose activity diminishes with time, was not a
new element, but bismuth made active by the vicinity of
radium in the pitchblende. I am not sure that this opinion
is correct. In the course of my prolonged work on
polonium, I have noted chemical effects, which I have
never observed either with ordinary bismuth or with
bismuth made active by radium. These chemical effects
are, in the first place, the extremely ready formation of
insoluble compounds, of which I have spoken above
(especially basic nitrates), and, in the second place, the
colour and appearance of the precipitates obtained by
adding water to the nitric acid solution of bismuth containing
polonium. These precipitates are sometimes white,
but more generally of a more or less vivid yellow, verging
on red.</p>

<p class='c010'>The absence of lines other than those of bismuth does
not necessarily prove that the substance only contains
bismuth, because bodies exist whose spectrum reaction is
scarcely visible.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be necessary to prepare a small quantity of
bismuth containing polonium in as concentrated a condition
as possible, and to examine it chemically, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>first place determining the atomic weight of the metal. It
has not yet been possible to carry out this research on
account of the difficulties of a chemical nature already
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c010'>If polonium were proved to be a new element, it would be
no less true that it cannot exist indefinitely in a strongly
radio-active condition, at least when extracted from the
ore. There are therefore two aspects of the question:—First,
whether the activity of polonium is entirely induced
by the proximity of substances themselves radio-active, in
which case polonium would possess the faculty of acquiring
atomic activity permanently, a faculty which does not
appear to belong to any substance whatever; second,
whether the activity of polonium is an inherent property,
which is spontaneously destroyed under certain conditions,
and persists under certain other conditions, such as those
which exist in the ore. The phenomenon of atomic activity
induced by contact is still so little understood, that we lack
the ground on which to formulate any opinion on the
matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<span class='sc'>Note.</span>—A work has recently appeared on polonium by
M. Marckwald. He plunges a small rod of pure bismuth
into a hydrochloric acid solution of the bismuth extracted
from the pitchblende residue. After some time the rod
becomes coated with a very active deposit, and the solution
now contains only inactive bismuth. M. Marckwald also
obtains a very active deposit by adding tin chloride to a
hydrochloric acid solution of radio-active bismuth. From
this he concludes that the active element is allied to
tellurium, and gives it the name of <i>radiotellurium</i>. This
active substance of M. Marckwald seems identical with
polonium, from its behaviour, and from the easily absorbed
rays it emits. The choice of a new name for this substance
is futile in the present state of the question).</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Preparation of the Pure Chloride of Radium.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The method by which I extracted pure radium chloride
from barium chloride containing radium consists in first
subjecting the mixture of the chlorides to fractional crystallisation
in pure water, then in water to which hydrochloric
acid has been added. The difference in solubility of the
two chlorides is thus made use of, that of radium being less
soluble than that of barium.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the beginning of the fractionation, pure distilled water
is used. The chloride is dissolved, and the solution raised
to boiling-point, and allowed to crystallise by cooling in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>covered capsule. Beautiful crystals form at the bottom,
and the supernatant, saturated solution is easily decanted.
If part of this solution be evaporated to dryness, the
chloride obtained is found to be about five times less active
than that which has crystallised out. The chloride is thus
divided into two portions, A and B—portion A being more
active than portion B. The operation is now repeated with
each of the chlorides A and B, and in each case two new
portions are obtained. When the crystallisation is finished,
the less active fraction of chloride A is added to the more
active fraction of chloride B, these two having approximately
the same activity. Thus there are now three
portions to undergo afresh the same treatment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The number of portions is not allowed to increase indefinitely.
The activity of the most soluble portion
diminishes as the number increases. When its activity
becomes inconsiderable, it is withdrawn from the fractionation.
When the desired number of fractions has been
obtained, fractionation of the least soluble portion is stopped
(the richest in radium), and it is withdrawn from the
remainder.</p>

<p class='c010'>A fixed number of fractions is used in the process. After
each series of operations, the saturated solution arising
from one fraction is added to the crystals arising from the
following fraction; but if after one of the series the most
soluble fraction has been withdrawn, then, after the following
series, a new fraction is made from the most soluble
portion, and the crystals of the most active portion are
withdrawn. By the successive alteration of these two
processes, an extremely regular system of fractionation is
obtained, in which the number of fractions and the activity
of each remains constant, each being about five times as
active as the subsequent one, and in which, on the one
hand, an almost inactive product is removed, whilst, on the
other, is obtained a chloride rich in radium. The amount
of material contained in these fractions gradually diminishes,
becoming less as the activity increases.</p>

<p class='c010'>At first six fractions were used, and the activity of the
chloride obtained at the end was only 0·1 that of uranium.</p>

<p class='c010'>When most of the inactive matter has been removed, and
the fractions have become small, one fraction is removed
from the one end, and another is added to the other end
consisting of the active chloride previously removed. A
chloride richer in radium than the preceding is thus
obtained. This system is continued until the crystals obtained
are pure radium chloride. If the fractionation has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>been thoroughly carried out, scarcely any trace of the intermediate
products remain.</p>

<p class='c010'>At an advanced stage of the fractionation, when the
quantity of material in each fraction is small, the separation
by crystallisation is less efficacious, the cooling being too
rapid and the volume of the solution to be decanted too
small. It is then advisable to add water containing a
known quantity of hydrochloric acid; this quantity may be
increased as the fractionation proceeds.</p>

<p class='c010'>The advantage gained thus consists in increasing the
quantity of the solution, the solubility of the chlorides being
less in water acidified with hydrochloric acid than in pure
water. By using water containing much acid, excellent
separations are effected, and it is only necessary to work
with three or four fractions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The crystals, which form in very acid solution, are
elongated needles, those of barium chloride having exactly
the same appearance as those of radium chloride. Both
show double refraction. Crystals of barium chloride containing
radium are colourless, but when the proportion of
radium becomes greater, they have a yellow colouration
after some hours, verging on orange, and sometimes a
beautiful pink. This colour disappears in solution. Crystals
of pure radium chloride are not coloured, so that the
colouration appears to be due to the mixture of radium and
barium. The maximum colouration is obtained for a
certain degree of radium present, and this fact serves to
check the progress of the fractionation.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have sometimes noticed the formation of a deposit
composed of crystals of which one part remained uncoloured,
whilst the other was coloured, and it seems
possible that the colourless crystals might be sorted out.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fractional precipitation of an aqueous solution of
barium chloride by alcohol also leads to the isolation of
radium chloride, which is the first to precipitate. This
method, which I first employed, was finally abandoned
for the one just described, which proceeds with more
regularity. I have, however, occasionally made use of
precipitation by alcohol to purify radium chloride which
contains traces of barium chloride. The latter remains in
the slightly aqueous alcoholic solution, and can thus be
removed.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Giesel, who, since the publication of our first researches,
has been preparing radio-active bodies, recommends
the separation of barium and radium by fractional
crystallisation in water from a mixture of the bromides. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>can testify that this method is advantageous, especially in
the first stages of the fractionation.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Determination of the Atomic Weight of Radium.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>In the course of my work I determined at intervals the
atomic weight of the metal contained in specimens of
barium chloride containing radium. With each newly
obtained product I carried the concentration as far as
possible, so as to have from 0·1 grm. to 0·5 grm. of
material containing most of the activity of the mixture.
From this small quantity I precipitated with alcohol or
with hydrochloric acid some milligrams of chloride for
spectral analysis. Thanks to his excellent method,
Demarçay only required this small quantity of material to
obtain the photograph of the spark spectrum. I made an
atomic weight determination with the product remaining.</p>

<p class='c010'>I employed the classic method of weighing as silver
chloride the chlorine contained in a known weight of the
anhydrous chloride. As control experiment, I determined
the atomic weight of barium by the same method, under
the same conditions, and with the same quantity of material,
first 0·5 grm. and then 0·1 grm. The figures obtained were
always between 137 and 138. I thus saw that the method
gives satisfactory results, even with a very small quantity of
material.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first two determinations were made with chlorides,
of which one was 230 times and the other 600 times as
active as uranium. These two experiments gave the same
figure as the experiment with the pure barium chloride.
There was therefore no hope of finding a difference except
by using a much more active product. The following
experiment was made with a chloride, the activity of which
was about 3500 times as great as that of uranium; and
this experiment enabled me, for the first time, to observe a
small but distinct difference; I found, as the mean atomic
weight of the metal contained in this chloride, the number
140, which showed that the atomic weight of radium must
be higher than that of barium. By using more and more
active products, and obtaining spectra of radium of increasing
intensity, I found that the figures obtained rose in
proportion, as is seen in the following table (p. <a href='#Page_28'>28</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The figures of column A must only be looked upon as a
rough estimate. The calculation of the activity of strongly
radio-active bodies is difficult, for many reasons which will
be discussed later.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the termination of the processes described above, I
obtained, in March, 1902, 0·12 grm. of radium chloride, of
which Demarçay made the spectral analysis. This

<p class='c010'>I then re-purified this chloride, and obtained a much
purer substance, in the spectrum of which the two strongest
barium lines were very faint. Given the sensitiveness of
the spectrum reaction of barium, Demarçay estimated that
the purified chloride contained only the merest traces of
barium, incapable of influencing the atomic weight to an
appreciable extent. I made three determinations with this
perfectly pure radium chloride. The results were as

<p class='c010'>The mean of these numbers is 225. They were calculated
in the same way as the preceding ones by considering
radium as a bivalent element, the chloride having
the formula RaCl<sub>2</sub>, and taking for silver and chlorine the
values Ag = 107·8, Cl = 35·4.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hence the atomic weight of radium is Ra = 225.</p>

<p class='c010'>The weighings were made with a Curie aperiodic
balance, perfectly regulated, accurate to the twentieth of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>milligrm. This direct reading balance permits of very
rapid weighing, a condition which is essential in the case
of the anhydrous chlorides of radium and barium, which
gradually absorb moisture, in spite of the presence of desiccating
substances in the balance. The bodies to be
weighed were placed in a platinum crucible; this crucible
had been long in use, and its weight did not vary the tenth
part of a milligrm. during the course of one operation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hydrated chloride obtained by crystallisation was
placed in the crucible and heated till converted into the
anhydrous chloride. When the chloride has been kept for
several hours at 100° its weight becomes constant, and does
not change even if the temperature is raised to 200°. The
anhydrous chloride thus obtained constitutes, therefore, a
perfectly definite body.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following is a series of determinations on this point.
The chloride (100 m.g.) is dried in the oven at 55°, and
placed in a desiccator over anhydrous phosphoric acid; it
then gradually loses weight, which proves that it still
contains moisture; in the course of twelve hours the loss
was 3 m.g. The chloride is replaced in the stove, and the
temperature raised to 100°. During this process, the
chloride lost 6·3 m.g. in weight. After being left three
hours fifteen minutes in the oven, it lost 2·5 m.g. more.
The temperature was maintained for forty-five minutes between
100° and 120°, which caused a loss of weight of 0·1
m.g. Then after being kept for thirty minutes at 125°, the
chloride showed no diminution in weight. Then, however,
after thirty minutes at 150°, it lost 0·1 m.g. Finally, after
being heated for four hours at 200°, it lost 0·15 m.g.
During these operations the crucible varied from 0·05 m.g.</p>

<p class='c010'>After each determination of the atomic weight, the
radium was converted into the chloride in the following
manner:—To the solution containing the weighed radium
nitrate and excess of silver nitrate was added pure hydrochloric
acid; the silver chloride was filtered off; the solution
was evaporated to dryness several times with excess of
pure hydrochloric acid. In this way the nitric acid is
entirely removed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The precipitated silver chloride was always radio-active
and phosphorescent. In determining the amount of silver
contained in it, I satisfied myself that no ponderable
amount of radium had been carried down with it out of the
solution. The method I pursued was to reduce the silver
chloride precipitated in the crucible by hydrogen generated
from dilute hydrochloric acid and zinc; after washing, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>crucible was weighed with the metallic silver contained
in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>I made another experiment which showed that the
weight of radium chloride regenerated was the same as that
before beginning the operation.</p>

<p class='c010'>These verifications are not so reliable as direct experiments;
but they serve to indicate the absence of any
significant error.</p>

<p class='c010'>From its chemical properties, radium is an element of
the group of alkaline earths, being the member next above
barium.</p>

<p class='c010'>From its atomic weight also, radium takes its place in
Mendeleeff’s table after barium with the alkaline earth
metals, in the row which already contains uranium and
thorium.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Characteristics of the Radium Salts.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The salts of radium, chloride, nitrate, carbonate, and
sulphate, resemble those of barium, when freshly prepared,
but they gradually become coloured.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the radium salts are luminous in the dark.</p>

<p class='c010'>In their chemical properties, the salts of radium are
absolutely analogous to the corresponding salts of barium.
However, radium chloride is less soluble than barium
chloride; the solubility of the nitrates in water is approximately
the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>The salts of radium are the source of a spontaneous and
continuous evolution of heat.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Fractionation of Ordinary Barium Chloride.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>We have endeavoured to determine whether commercial
barium chloride contains small quantities of radium
chloride, which escape detection with the means of
estimation at our command. For this purpose we fractionated
a great quantity of commercial barium chloride, in
the hope of thus concentrating the trace of radium chloride
if such were present.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fifty kilos. of commercial barium chloride were dissolved
in water; the solution was precipitated by hydrochloric
acid free from sulphuric acid, which yielded 20 kilos. of the
precipitated chloride. This was dissolved in water and
partially precipitated by hydrochloric acid, which gave 8·5
kilos. of precipitated chloride. This chloride was fractionated
by the method used for the barium chloride containing
radium; and at the end of the process, 10 grams of
chloride were obtained, corresponding to the least soluble
part. This chloride showed no radio-activity; it therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>contained no radium; this substance is, consequently,
absent from the ores of barium.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c011'><i>Methods of Investigation of the Radiation.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>In order to investigate the radiation emitted by radio-active
bodies, any one of the properties of this radiation
can be utilised. Thus the action of the rays on photographic
plates may serve, or their property of ionisation
of the air, which renders it a conductor, or their capacity
for causing fluorescence of certain bodies. Henceforth, in
speaking of these different methods of working, I shall use
the expressions radiographic method, electrical method,
fluoroscopic method.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first two have been used from the beginning in the
study of uranium rays; the fluoroscopic method can only
be applied in the case of the new bodies which are strongly
radio-active, for the feebly active bodies such as uranium
and thorium produce no appreciable fluorescence. The
electrical method is the only one which serves for exact
determinations of intensity; the other two are specially
adapted for giving qualitative results, and only furnish
rough approximations. The results obtained with the three
methods just considered are not strictly comparable the one
with the other. The sensitive plate, the gas which is
ionised, the fluorescent screen, are in reality receivers,
which absorb the energy of the radiation, and transform it
into another kind of energy, chemical energy, ionic energy,
or luminous energy. Each receiver absorbs a fraction of
the radiation, which depends essentially upon its nature.
Later on, we shall see that the radiation is complex, that
the fractions of the radiation absorbed by the different
receivers may differ among themselves both quantitatively
and qualitatively. Finally, it is neither evident, nor even
probable, that the energy absorbed is entirely transformed
by the receiver into the form that we wish for observation;
part of this energy may be transformed into heat, into the
evolution of secondary radiations which may or may not
assist in the production of the observed phenomenon,
into chemical action which differs from that under observation,
&amp;c., and here also the effective action of the
receiver, with reference to the end we have in view,
depends essentially upon the nature of that receiver.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us compare two radio-active substances, one containing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>radium and the other polonium, and which show an
equal degree of activity in the condenser of Fig. 1. If each
is covered with a thin leaf of aluminium, the second appears
considerably less active than the first, and the same is the
case when they are placed under the same fluorescent
screen, if the latter is of sufficient thickness, or is placed
at a certain distance from the two radio-active bodies.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Energy of Radiation.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>Whatever be the method of research employed, the
energy of radiation of the new radio-active substances is
always found to be considerably greater than that of
uranium and thorium. Thus it is that, at a short distance,
they act instantaneously upon a photographic plate,
whereas an exposure of twenty-four hours is necessary
when operating with uranium and thorium. A fluorescent
screen is vividly illuminated by contact with the new radio-active
bodies, whilst no trace of luminosity is visible with
uranium and thorium. Finally, the ionising action upon
air is considerably stronger in the ratio of 10<sup>6</sup> approximately.
But it is, strictly speaking, not possible to estimate the
<i>total intensity of the radiation</i>, as in the case of uranium,
by the electrical method described at the beginning (Fig.
1). With uranium, for example, the radiation is almost
completely absorbed by the layer of air between the plates,
and the limiting current is reached at a tension of 100
volts. But the case is different for strongly radio-active
bodies. One portion of the radiation of radium consists of
very penetrating rays, which penetrate the condenser and
the metallic plates, and are not utilised in ionising the air
between the plates. Further, the limiting current cannot
always be obtained for the tensions supplied; for example,
with very active polonium the current remains proportional
to the tension between 100 and 500 volts. Therefore the
experimental conditions which give a simple interpretation
are not realised, and, consequently, the numbers obtained
cannot be taken as representing the measurement of the
total radiation; they merely point to a rough approximation.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Complex Nature of the Radiation.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The researches of various physicists (MM. Becquerel,
Meyer and von Schweidler, Giesel, Villard, Rutherford,
M. and Mdme. Curie) have proved the complex nature of
the radiation of radio-active bodies. It will be convenient
to specify three kinds of rays, which I shall denote,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>according to the notation adopted by Mr. Rutherford, by the
letters α, β, γ.</p>

<p class='c010'>I. The α-rays are very slightly penetrating, and appear
to constitute the principal part of the radiation. These
rays are characterised by the laws by which they are
absorbed by matter. The magnetic field acts very slightly
upon them, and they were formerly thought to be quite
unaffected by the action of this field. However, in a strong
magnetic field, the α-rays are slightly deflected; the deflection
is caused in the same manner as with cathode rays,
but the direction of the deflection is reversed; it is the same
as for the canal rays of the Crookes tubes.</p>

<p class='c010'>II. The β-rays are less absorbable as a whole than the
preceding ones. They are deflected by a magnetic field in
the same manner and direction as cathode rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>III. The γ-rays are penetrating rays, unaffected by the
magnetic field, and comparable to Röntgen rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>Consider the following imaginary experiment:—Some
radium, <span class='fss'>R</span>, is placed at the bottom of a small deep cavity,
hollowed in a
block of lead, <span class='fss'>P</span>
(Fig. 4). A sheaf
of rays, rectilinear
and
slightly expanded,
streams
from the receptacle.
Let us
suppose that a
strong uniform
magnetic field is
established in
the neighbourhood
of the receptacle,
normal
to the plane
of the figure and
directed towards
the back.
The three groups of rays, α, β, γ, will now be separated.
Then rather faint γ-rays continue in their straight
path without a trace of deviation. The β-rays are
deflected in the manner of cathode rays, and describe
circular paths in the plane of the figure. If the receptacle
is placed on a photographic plate, <span class='fss'>A C</span>, the portion, <span class='fss'>B C</span>, of
the plate which receives the β-rays is acted upon. Lastly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the α-rays form a very intense shaft which is slightly
deflected, and which is soon absorbed by the air. These
rays describe in the plane of the figure a path of great
curvature, the direction of the deflection being the reverse
of that with the β-rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the receptacle is covered with a thin sheet of aluminium
(0·1 m.m. thick), the α-rays are suppressed almost entirely,
the β-rays are lessened, and the γ-rays do not appear to be
absorbed to any great extent.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Action of the Magnetic Field.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>We have seen that the rays emitted by radio-active
bodies have many properties common to cathode rays
and to Röntgen rays. Cathode rays, as well as Röntgen
rays, ionise the air, act on photographic plates, cause
fluorescence, undergo no regular deflection. But the
cathode rays differ from Röntgen rays in being deflected
from their rectilinear path by the action of the magnetic
field, and in the transportation of charges of negative
electricity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fact that the magnetic field acts upon the rays
emitted by radio-active substances was discovered almost
simultaneously by MM. Giesel, Meyer and von Schweidler,
and Becquerel. These physicists observed that the rays
of radio-active substances are deflected by the magnetic
field in the same manner and direction as the cathode
rays; their observations were in relation to the β-rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Curie demonstrated that the radiation of radium
comprises two groups of quite distinct rays, of which one is
readily deflected by the magnetic field (β-rays), whilst the
other seems to be unaffected by the action of this field (α-
and γ-rays).</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Becquerel did not find that the specimens of polonium
prepared by us emitted rays of the cathode kind. On the
contrary, he first noticed the effect of the magnetic field on
a specimen of polonium prepared by himself. None of the
polonium prepared by us ever gave rise to rays of the
cathode order.</p>

<p class='c010'>The polonium of M. Giesel only gives rise to these rays
when recently prepared, and it is probable that the emission
is due to the phenomenon of induced radio-activity of which
we shall speak later.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following are experiments which prove that one
portion of the radiation of radium, and one portion only,
consists of easily deflected rays (β-rays). These experiments
were done according to the electrical method.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>The radio-active body <span class='fss'>A</span> (Fig. 5) sends forth radiations
in the direction <span class='fss'>A D</span> between the plates <span class='fss'>P</span> and <span class='fss'>P′</span>. The plate
<span class='fss'>P</span> is now at a potential of 500 volts, plate <span class='fss'>P′</span> is connected to
an electrometer and to a quartz electric piezometer. The
intensity of the current passing through the air under the
influence of the radiations is measured. The magnetic
field can be established at will perpendicular to the plane
of the figure over the whole region <span class='fss'>E E E E</span>. If the rays are
deflected, even slightly, they no longer pass between the
plates, and the current is suppressed. The region of the
passage of the rays is surrounded with masses of lead,
<span class='fss'>B</span>, <span class='fss'>B′</span>, <span class='fss'>B″</span>, and by the armatures of the
electro-magnet; when the rays are deflected,
they are absorbed by the masses
of lead <span class='fss'>B</span> and <span class='fss'>B′</span>.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/f_05.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 5.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The results obtained depend essentially
on the distance, <span class='fss'>A D</span>, of the radiating substance,
<span class='fss'>A</span>, from the condenser at <span class='fss'>D</span>. If
the distance <span class='fss'>A D</span> is great enough (greater
than 7 c.m.), most of the radium rays (90
to 100 per cent) arriving at the condenser
are deflected and suppressed for a field of
2500 units. These are the β-rays. If the
distance <span class='fss'>A D</span> is less than 65 m.m., a
smaller part of the rays are deflected by
the action of the field; this portion is also
entirely deflected by a field of 2500 units,
and the proportion of the rays suppressed
is not increased by increasing the field from 2500 to
7000 units.</p>

<p class='c010'>The proportion of the rays not suppressed by the field
increases with decrease of the distance, <span class='fss'>A D</span>, between the
radiating body and the condenser. For small distances,
the rays which can be easily deflected form a very small
fraction of the total radiation. The penetrating rays are
therefore, for the most part, deviable rays of the cathode
order (β-rays).</p>

<p class='c010'>Under the experimental conditions just described, the
action of the magnetic field on the α-rays could not be well
observed for the fields employed. The chief radiation,
apparently undergoing no deflection, observed at a short
distance from the radiating source, consisted of α-rays; the
undeflected radiation observed at a greater distance consisted
of γ-rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>If an absorbing lamina (aluminium or black paper) is
placed in the path of the bundle of rays, those which pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>through are nearly all deflected by the field in such a way
that, with the aid of the screen and the magnetic field,
almost all the radiation is suppressed in the condenser, the
remainder being due to the γ-rays, the proportion of which
is small. The α-rays are absorbed by the screen.</p>

<p class='c010'>An aluminium plate of 1/100 m.m. thickness is sufficient
for the suppression of almost all the rays not readily
deflected when the substance is far enough from the condenser;
for smaller distances (34 m.m. and 51 m.m.) two pieces
of this aluminium foil are necessary to give the same result.</p>

<p class='c010'>Similar determinations were made with four substances
containing radium (chlorides or carbonates) of very different
activity; analogous results were obtained.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be remarked that, in all cases, the penetrating
rays deflected by the magnet (β-rays) form only a small
fraction of the total radiation; they influence but slightly
the determinations in which the whole radiation is made
use of to produce conductivity of the air.</p>

<p class='c010'>The radiation emitted by polonium may be studied by
the electrical method. When the distance, <span class='fss'>A D</span>, of the
polonium from the condenser is varied, no current is observed
at first while the distance is fairly great; on nearing
the polonium, the radiation suddenly becomes manifest
with great intensity; the current then increases uniformly
whilst approaching the polonium, but the magnetic field
produces no appreciable effect under these conditions. The
radiation of polonium is apparently limited in space, and
does not pass into the air beyond a kind of sheath surrounding
the substance to a thickness of several centimetres.</p>

<p class='c010'>The interpretation of the experiments I have just
described must be accompanied by some important general
reservations. In speaking of the proportion of the rays
deflected by the magnet, I refer only to that portion of the
radiation capable of causing a current in the condenser. In
employing the fluorescent action of the Becquerel rays, or
their action on photographic plates, the proportion would
probably be different—a measure of intensity having, as a
rule, no meaning except for the method of measurement
adopted.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rays of polonium are α-rays. In the experiments
just described, I observed no action of the magnetic field
upon them, but the experimental conditions were such that
a slight deflection would pass unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The experiments made by the radiographic method confirmed
the preceding results. Taking radium as the source
of radiation, and receiving the impression on a plate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>parallel to the primitive shaft and normal to the field, a
very clear print is obtained of two shafts separated by the
action of the field, the one deflected, the other not deflected.
The β-rays constitute the deflected beam; the
α-rays, being very slightly deflected, are not to be distinguished
from the undeflected bundle of the γ-rays.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Deflected β-Rays.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The experiments of M. Giesel and MM. Meyer and von
Schweidler showed that the radiation of the radio-active
bodies is, in part at least, deflected by a magnetic field, and
that this deflection resembles that of the cathode rays. M.
Becquerel investigated the action of the field on the rays
by the radiographic method. The experimental arrangement
was that of Fig. 4. The radium was placed in the
lead receptacle, <span class='fss'>P</span>, and this receptacle was placed on the
sensitive face of a photographic plate, <span class='fss'>A C</span>, covered with
black paper. The whole was placed between the poles of
an electro-magnet, the magnetic field being normal to the
plane of the figure.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the field is directed to the back of this plane, the part
<span class='fss'>B C</span> of the plate is acted upon by rays which, after having
described circular paths, return to the plate and strike it at
a right angle. These rays are β-rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Becquerel has demonstrated that the impression
consists of a wide diffused band, a continuous spectrum
indeed, showing that the sheaf of deviable rays emitted by
the source is formed of an infinite number of radiations
unequally deflected. If the gelatin of the plate be covered
with different absorbent screens (paper, glass, metals), one
portion of the spectrum is suppressed, and it is found that
the rays most deflected by the magnetic field—otherwise
those which have the smallest radius of curvature—are the
most completely absorbed. With each screen, the impression
on the plate begins at a certain distance from the
source of radiation, this distance being proportional to the
absorptive power of the screen.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Charge of the Deflected Rays.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The cathode rays are, as shown by M. Perrin, charged
with negative electricity. Further, according to the experiments
of M. Perrin and M. Lenard, they are capable of
carrying their charge through the metallic envelopes connected
to earth and through isolating screens. At every
point where the cathode rays are absorbed, there is a continuous
evolution of negative electricity. We have proved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>that the same is the case for the deflected β-rays of
radium. <i>The deviable β-rays of radium are charged with
negative electricity.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>(<span class='sc'>Note.</span>—Let the radio-active substance be placed on one
of the plates of a condenser, this plate being connected to
earth; the second plate is connected to an electrometer, it
receives and absorbs the rays emitted by the substance. If
the rays are charged, a continuous flow of electricity into
the electrometer should be observed. In this experiment,
carried out in air, we were not able to detect a charge
accompanying the rays, but such an experiment is not
delicate. The air between the plates being caused by the
rays to conduct, the electrometer is no longer isolated, and
can only respond to charges if these be sufficiently strong.
In order that the α-rays may not interfere with the
experiment, they may be suppressed by covering the source
of radiation with a thin metallic screen. We repeated this
experiment, without more success, by causing the rays
to pass through the interior of a Faraday cylinder in
connection with the electrometer).</p>

<p class='c010'>According to the preceding experiments, it was evident
that the charge of the rays of the radiating body employed
was a weak one.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order to fix a feeble evolution of electricity upon the
conductor which absorbs the rays, this conductor should be
completely insulated; this is effected by screening it from
the air, either by placing it in a tube with a very perfect
vacuum, or by surrounding it with a good solid dielectric.
We employed the latter arrangement.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/f_06.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 6.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A conducting disc, <span class='fss'>M M</span> (Fig. 6), is connected by the wire,
<i>t</i>, to the electrometer;
the disc
and wire are completely
enveloped
by the insulating
substance <i>i i i i</i>;
the whole is again
surrounded with
the metallic
covering, <span class='fss'>E E E E</span>, which is in electric connection with the
earth. The insulator, <i>p p</i>, and the metallic envelope are very
thin upon one of the faces of the disc. This face is exposed to
the radiation of the barium and radium salt, <span class='fss'>R</span>, placed outside
in a lead receptacle. The rays emitted by the radium
penetrate the metallic envelope and the insulating lamina,
<i>p p</i>, and are absorbed by the metallic disc, <span class='fss'>M M</span>. The latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>then becomes the source of a continuous evolution of
negative electricity, as determined by the electrometer, and
is measured by means of a quartz piezometer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The current thus created is very weak. With very
active barium-radium chloride, forming a layer of 2·5 sq.
c.m. in area, and of 0·2 c.m. in thickness, a current of
magnitude 10<sup>–11</sup> ampères is obtained, the rays utilised
having traversed, before being absorbed by the disc <span class='fss'>M M</span>, a
thickness of aluminium of 0·01 m.m., and a thickness of
ebonite of 0·3 m.m.</p>

<p class='c010'>We used successively lead, copper, and zinc for the disc
<span class='fss'>M M</span>, ebonite and paraffin for the insulator; the results
obtained were the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>The current diminishes with increasing distance from the
source of radiation, <span class='fss'>R</span>, also when a less active product is used.</p>

<p class='c010'>We obtained the same results again when the disc <span class='fss'>M M</span> is
replaced by a Faraday cylinder filled with air, and covered
outside with insulating material. The opening of the
cylinder, closed by the thin insulating plate, <i>p p</i>, was
opposite the radiating source.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/f_07.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 7.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Finally, we made the inverse experiment, which was to
place the lead receptacle with the radium in the centre of
the insulating material and in connection with the electrometer
(Fig. 7), the whole being surrounded with the
metallic covering connected to earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under these conditions, it is evident from the electrometer
that the radium has a positive charge equal in magnitude to
the negative charge of the former experiment. The radium
rays penetrate the thin dielectric plate, <i>p p</i>, and leave the
conductor inside carrying with them negative electricity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The α-rays of radium do not interfere in these experiments,
being almost completely absorbed by a very thin layer of
matter. The method just described is not suitable for the study
of the charge of the rays of polonium, these rays very slightly
penetrating. We observed no indication of any charge in the
case of polonium, which gives rise to α-rays only; but, for
the reason just given, no conclusion can be drawn from this.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Thus, in the case of the deflected β-rays of radium, as
in the case of cathode rays, the rays carry a charge of
electricity. But, hitherto, the existence of electric charges
uncombined with matter has been unknown. In the study
of the emission of the β-rays of radium, we are therefore
led to make use of the theory which is in vogue for the
study of cathode rays. In this ballistic theory, formulated
by Sir William Crookes, since developed and completed by
Prof. J. J. Thomson, the cathode rays consist of extremely
minute particles, which are hurled from the cathode with
great velocity, and which are charged with negative
electricity. We might similarly conceive that radium
sends into space negatively electrified particles.</p>

<p class='c010'>A specimen of radium, enclosed in a solid thin perfectly
insulated envelope, should become spontaneously charged
to a very high potential. By the ballistic hypothesis the
potential would increase until the potential difference of
the surrounding conductors became sufficient to hinder the
ejection of the electrified particles and to cause their return
to the source of radiation.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have performed an experiment on these lines. A
specimen of very active radium was enclosed for some time
in a glass vessel. In order to open the vessel, we made a
trace on the glass with a glass cutter. Whilst so doing,
we clearly heard the report of a spark, and upon examining
the vessel with a magnifying glass, we observed that the
glass had been pierced by a spark at the spot where it had
been weakened by the scratch. The phenomenon produced
is comparable to the rupture of the glass of an overcharged
Leyden jar.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same phenomenon occurred with another glass.
Further, at the moment of the passing of the spark, M.
Curie, who was holding the glass, felt the electric shock of
discharge in his fingers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Certain kinds of glass have good insulating properties.
If the radium is enclosed in a sealed glass vessel, well
insulated, it is to be expected that, at a given moment, the
vessel will be spontaneously perforated.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Radium is the first example of a body which is spontaneously
charged with electricity.</i></p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Action of the Electric Field upon the Deflected β-Rays of Radium.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The β-rays of radium, being analogous to the cathode
rays, should be deflected by an electric field in a manner
similar to the latter; <i>i.e.</i>, as would a particle of matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>negatively charged and hurled into space with a great
velocity. The existence of such a deflection has been
demonstrated both by M. Dorn and M. Becquerel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us consider the case of a ray which traverses the
space situated between the two plates of a condenser.
Suppose the direction of the ray parallel to the plates: when
an electric field is established between the latter, the ray is
subjected to the action of this uniform field along its whole
path in the condenser l. By reason of this action the ray
is deflected towards the positive plate and describes the arc
of a parabola; on leaving the field, it continues its path in
a straight line, following the tangent to the arc of the
parabola at the point of exit. The ray can be received on
a photographic plate perpendicular to its original direction.
Observations are taken of the impression produced on the
plate when the field is zero, and when it has a known
value, and from that is deduced the value of the deflection,
δ, which is the distance of the points in which the new
direction of the ray and its original direction meet a
common plane perpendicular to the original direction. If
h is the distance of this plane from the condenser, <i>i.e.</i>, at
the edge of the field, we have, by a simple calculation,—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i_041a.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c030'><i>m</i> being the mass of the moving particles, <i>e</i> its charge, <i>v</i> its
velocity, and F the strength of the field.</p>

<p class='c010'>The experiments of M. Becquerel enable him to assign a
value approaching to δ.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Relation of the Charge to the Mass for a Particle Negatively Charged Emitted by Radium.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>When a material particle having a mass <i>m</i> and a negative
charge <i>e</i>, is projected with a velocity <i>v</i> into a uniform magnetic
field perpendicular to its initial velocity, this particle
describes, in a plane normal to the field and passing through
its initial velocity, an arc of a circle of radius ρ, so that—H
being the strength of the field—we have the relation—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i_041b.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>If, for the same ray, the deflection, δ, and the radius of
curvature, ρ, be measured in a magnetic field, values could
be found from these two experiments for the ratio <span class='fraction'><i>e</i><br /><span class='vincula'><i>m</i></span></span> and for
the velocity, <i>v</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The experiments of M. Becquerel threw the first light
upon this subject. They gave for the ratio <span class='fraction'><i>e</i><br /><span class='vincula'><i>m</i></span></span> a value approximately
equal to 10<sup>7</sup> absolute electro-magnetic units,
and for v a magnitude of 1·6 × 10<sup>10</sup>. These values are of the
same order of magnitude as those of the cathode rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>Accurate experiments have been made on the same subject
by M. Kaufmann. This physicist subjected a narrow beam
of radium rays to the simultaneous action of an electric field
and a magnetic field, the two fields being uniform and having
a similar direction, normal to the original direction of the
beam. The impression produced on a plate normal to the
primitive beam and placed beyond the limits of the field with
reference to the source, has the form of a curve, each point
of which corresponds to one of the original beam. The
most penetrating and least deflected rays are at the same
time those with the greatest velocity.</p>

<p class='c010'>It follows from the experiments of M. Kaufmann, that for
the radium rays, of which the velocity is considerably greater
than that of the cathode rays, the ratio <span class='fraction'><i>e</i><br /><span class='vincula'><i>m</i></span></span> decreases, while
the velocity increases.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to the researches of J. J. Thomson and Townsend,
we may assume that the moving particle, which constitutes
the ray, possesses a charge, <i>e</i>, equal to that carried by
an atom of hydrogen during electrolysis, this charge being
the same for all the rays. We are therefore led to the conclusion
that the mass of the particle, <i>m</i>, increases with
increase of velocity.</p>

<p class='c010'>These theoretical considerations lead to the idea that the
inertia of the particle is due to its state of charge during
motion, the velocity of an electric charge in motion being
incapable of modification without expenditure of energy. To
state it otherwise, the inertia of the particle is of electro-magnetic
origin, and the mass of the particle is—in part at
least—a virtual mass or an electro-magnetic mass. M.
Abraham goes further, and assumes that the mass of the
particle is entirely an electro-magnetic mass. If, according
to this hypothesis, the value of this mass, <i>m</i>, be calculated
for a known velocity, <i>v</i>, we find that <i>m</i> approaches infinity
when <i>v</i> approaches the velocity of light, and that <i>m</i> approaches
a constant value when the velocity, <i>v</i>, is much less than that
of light. The experiments of M. Kaufmann are in agreement
with the results of this theory, the importance of which is
great because it foreshadows the possibility of establishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>mechanical bases upon the dynamical of little particles of
matter charged in a state of motion.</p>

<p class='c010'>These are the figures obtained by M. Kaufmann for <span class='fraction'><i>e</i><br /><span class='vincula'><i>m</i></span></span>
and <i>v</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Kaufmann concludes, from comparison of his experiments
with the theory, that the limiting value of the ratio <span class='fraction'><i>e</i><br /><span class='vincula'><i>m</i></span></span>
for radium rays of relatively small velocity would be the
same as the value <span class='fraction'><i>e</i><br /><span class='vincula'><i>m</i></span></span> for cathode rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most complete experiments of M. Kaufmann were
made with a minute quantity of pure radium chloride, with
which we provided him.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to M. Kaufmann’s experiments, certain β-rays
of radium possess a velocity very near to that of light.
These rapid rays seem to possess great penetrating capacity
towards matter.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Action of the Magnetic Field upon the α-Rays.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>In a recent work, Mr. Rutherford announced that, in a
powerful electric or magnetic field, the α-rays of radium are
slightly deflected, in the manner of particles positively electrified
and possessing great velocity. Mr. Rutherford concludes
from his experiments that the velocity of the α-rays is of the
order of magnitude 2·5 × 10<sup>9</sup><span class='fraction'>c.m.<br /><span class='vincula'>sec.</span></span> and that the ratio <span class='fraction'><i>e</i><br /><span class='vincula'><i>m</i></span></span> for
these rays is of the order of magnitude 6 × 10<sup>3</sup>, which is 10<sup>4</sup>
times as great as for the deflected β-rays. We shall see
later that these conclusions of Mr. Rutherford are in agreement
with the properties already known of the α-radiation,
and that they account, in part at least, for the law of absorption
of this radiation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The experiments of Mr. Rutherford have been confirmed
by M. Becquerel. M. Becquerel has further demonstrated
that polonium rays behave in a magnetic field like the α-rays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of radium, and that, for the same field, they seem to have
the same curvature as the latter.</p>

<p class='c010'>It also appears from M. Becquerel’s experiments that the
α-rays do not form a magnetic spectrum, but act rather like a
homogeneous radiation, all the rays being equally deflected.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Action of the Magnetic Field on the Rays of other Radio-active Substances.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>We have just seen that radium gives off α-rays comparable
to the tube rays, β-rays comparable to cathode rays,
and γ-rays which are penetrating and not deflected. Polonium
gives off α-rays only. Amongst the other radio-active
substances, actinium seems to behave like radium, but the
study of its radiation has not yet advanced so far as in the
case of radium. As regards the faintly radio-active bodies,
we know to-day that uranium and thorium give rise to α-rays
as well as β-rays (Becquerel, Rutherford).</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Proportion of β-Rays in the Radiation of Radium.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>As I have already mentioned, the proportion of β-rays increases
with increase of distance from the source of radiation.
These rays never occur alone, and for great distances the
presence of γ-rays is always discernible. The presence of
very penetrating, undeflected rays in the radiation of radium
was first observed by M. Villard. These rays constitute only
a small portion of the radiation measured by the electrical
method, and their presence escaped our notice in our first
experiments, so that we believed falsely that the radiation at
great distances contained only rays capable of deflection.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following are the numerical results obtained with experiments
made by the electrical method with an apparatus
similar to that of Fig. 5. The radium was only separated
from the condenser by the surrounding air. I shall indicate
by the letter <i>d</i> the distance from the source of radiation to
the condenser. The numbers of the second line represent
the current subsisting when the magnetic field is acting,
supposing the current obtained with no field equal to 100 for
each distance. These numbers may be considered as giving
the percentage of the total α- and γ-rays, the deflection of
the α-rays having been scarcely observable with the conditions
employed.</p>

<p class='c010'>At great distances there are no α-rays, and the undeflected
radiation is therefore of the γ kind only.</p>

<p class='c010'>As in the preceding experiments, the number of the
second line approximate to a constant value, when the
distance <i>d</i> increases, but the limit is reached for smaller
distances than in the preceding series, because the α-rays
have been more completely absorbed by the glass than the
β- and γ-rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following experiment shows that a thin sheet of
aluminium (0·01 m.m. thick) absorbs principally α-rays.
The product being placed 5 c.m. from the condenser, the
proportion of rays other than β, when the magnetic field is
acting, is about 71 per cent. When the same substance is
covered with the sheet of aluminium, the distance remaining
the same, the radiation transmitted is found to be
almost totally deflected by the magnetic field, the α-rays
having been absorbed by the aluminium. The same result
is obtained when paper is used as the absorbing screen.</p>

<p class='c010'>The greatest part of the radiation of radium consists of
α-rays, which are probably emitted principally by the
superficial layer of the radiating matter. When the thickness
of the layer of radiating matter is varied, the intensity
of the current increases with this thickness; the increase is
not proportional to the thickness for the whole of the
radiation; it is, moreover, more considerable for the β-rays
than for the α-rays, so that the proportion of β-rays increases
with the thickness of the active layer. The source of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>radiation being placed at a distance of 5 c.m. from the
condenser, it is found that for a thickness equal to 0·4
m.m. of the active layer, the total radiation is given by the
number 28, and the proportion of the β-rays is 29 per cent.
By making the layer 2 m.m. thick, <i>i.e.</i>, five times as thick,
a total radiation equal to 102, and a proportion of β-rays
equal to 45 per cent are obtained. The total radiation
which exists at this distance has therefore been increased
in the ratio of 3·6, and the β-radiation has become five
times as strong.</p>

<p class='c010'>The preceding experiments were made by the electrical
method. When the radiographic method is used, certain
results seem to be in contradiction with what precedes. In
the experiments of M. Villard, a beam of radium rays, subjected
to the action of the magnetic field, was received on
to a pile of photographic plates. The undeflected and
penetrating γ-beam passed through all the plates, leaving
its trace on each. The deflected β-beam produced an impression
on the first plate only. This beam appeared
therefore to contain no rays of great penetration.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the contrary, in our experiments a beam which is
propagated in the air contains at the greatest distances
accessible to observation about 9/10 of β-rays, and the same
is the case when the source of radiation is enclosed in a little
sealed glass vessel. In M. Villard’s experiments, these
deflected and penetrating β-rays did not affect the photographic
plates beyond the first, because they are to a great
extent diffused in all directions by the first solid obstacle
encountered, and no longer form a beam. In our experiments
the rays given off by radium and transmitted through
the glass of the vessel were also probably scattered by the
glass, but the vessel being very small would itself act as a
source of β-rays at its surface, and we were able to follow
the course of the latter to a great distance from the vessel.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cathode rays of Crookes tubes can only traverse
very thin screens (aluminium screens of 0·01 m.m. thickness).
A beam of rays striking the screen normally is
scattered in all directions; but the diffusion becomes less
with diminishing thickness of the screen, and for very thin
screens the emerging beam is practically the prolongation
of the incident beam.</p>

<p class='c010'>The deflected β-rays of radium behave in a similar
manner, but the transmitted beam experiences, for the
same thickness of screen, a much slighter modification.
According to the experiments of M. Becquerel, the very
readily deflected β-rays of radium (those with a relatively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>small velocity) are powerfully scattered by an aluminium
screen of thickness 0·1 m.m.; but the penetrating and less
deflected rays (rays of the cathode kind of great velocity)
pass through this screen without being sensibly diffused,
whatever be the inclination of the screen to the direction of
the beam. The β-rays of great velocity penetrate without
diffusion a much greater thickness of paraffin (several centimetres),
and in this the curvature of the beam produced
by the magnetic field can be traced. The thicker the
screen, and the more absorbent the material of which it
is composed, the greater is the modification of the deflected
primitive beam, because, with increasing thickness of
screen, diffusion occurs progressively among fresh groups of
rays of increasing penetration.</p>

<p class='c010'>The β-rays of radium experience a diffusion in passing
through the air, which is very marked for readily deflected
rays, but which is much slighter than that produced by
equal thicknesses of solid substances. For this reason, the
β-rays traverse long distances in the air.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Penetrating Power of the Radiation of Radio-active Bodies.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>Since the beginning of the researches on radio-active
bodies, investigations of the absorption produced by different
screens upon the rays given off by these bodies have been
carried on. In a previous paper on this subject I gave
figures (quoted at the beginning of this work) representing
the penetrating power of uranium and thorium rays. Mr.
Rutherford has made a special study of the radiation of
uranium, and proved it to be heterogeneous. Mr. Owens
has arrived at the same results for thorium rays. When
the discovery of strongly radio-active bodies immediately
followed upon this, the penetrating power of their rays was
also studied by various physicists (Becquerel, Meyer and
von Schweidler, Curie, Rutherford). The first observations
brought to light the complexity of the radiation, which
seems to be a general phenomenon, and common to the
radio-active bodies. In them we have sources which give
rise to a variety of radiations, each of which has a power
of penetration proper to itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Radio-active bodies emit rays which are propagated both
in the air and <i>in vacuo</i>. The propagation is rectilinear;
this fact is proved by the distinctness and shape of the
shadows formed by interposing bodies opaque to the radiation
between the source and the sensitive plate or fluorescent
screen which serves as receiver, the source being of small
magnitude in comparison with its distance from the receiver.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Various experiments demonstrating the rectilinear propagation
of uranium, radium, and polonium rays have been
made by M. Becquerel.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is interesting to know the distance that rays can travel
in air. We have found that radium emits rays which can
be detected in the air at a distance of several metres from
the source. In certain of our electrical determinations, the
action of the source upon the air of the condenser made
itself felt at a distance of between 2 and 3 metres. We
have also obtained fluorescent effects and radiographic impressions
at similar distances. The experiments are not
easily carried out, except with very intense radio-active
sources, because, independently of the absorption by the
air, the action upon a given receiver varies inversely as the
square of the distance from a source of small dimensions.
This radiation, which travels a long distance in the case of
radium, comprises rays of the cathode kind and rays which
are undeflected; however, the deflected rays predominate,
according to the results of the experiments already mentioned.
The greater part of the radiation (α-rays) is, on
the contrary, limited in air to a distance of about 7 c.m.
from the source.</p>

<p class='c010'>I made several experiments with radium enclosed in a
little glass vessel. The rays emerging from the vessel,
after traversing a certain space of air, were received in a
condenser, which served to measure their ionising capacity
by the usual electrical method. The distance, <i>d</i>, from the
source to the condenser was varied, and the current of
saturation, <i>i</i>, obtained in the condenser was measured.

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>In the case of the absorption of radiations by solid
screens, we find another fundamental difference between
radium and polonium. Radium emits rays capable of
penetrating great thicknesses of solid matter, <i>e.g.</i>, several
centimetres of lead or of glass. The rays which have
passed through a great thickness of a solid body are extremely
penetrating, and it is practically impossible to
absorb them entirely by any material whatever. But these
rays form only a small fraction of the total radiation, the
greater part of which is absorbed by a slight thickness of
solid matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>We see that radium compounds of different nature and
activity give very similar results, as I have already pointed
out in the case of uranium and thorium compounds at the
beginning of this work. We see also that, taking into
account the whole of the radiation, and with a given
absorbent screen, the different radio-active bodies can be
arranged in the following decreasing order of penetrating
power:—Thorium, radium, polonium, uranium.</p>

<p class='c010'>These results are similar to those which have been published
by Mr. Rutherford.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Rutherford also finds that the order is the same when
air is the absorbent substance. But it is probable that this
order has no absolute value, and would not be maintained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>independently of the nature and thickness of the screen.
Experiment shows, indeed, that the law of absorption is
very different for polonium and radium, and that, for the
latter, the absorption of the rays of each of the three groups
must be considered separately.</p>

<p class='c010'>Polonium is particularly well adapted to the study of α-rays,
because the specimens which we possess emit no
other kind of rays. I made a preliminary series of experiments
with extremely active recently prepared specimens of
polonium. I found the absorbability of the rays to increase
with increase of thickness of the matter traversed. This
singular law of absorption is contrary to that known for
other kinds of radiation.</p>

<p class='c010'>I employed for this research our apparatus for the determination
of electrical conductivity arranged in the following
manner:—</p>

<p class='c010'>The two plates of a condenser, <span class='fss'>P P</span> and <span class='fss'>P′ P′</span> (Fig 8), are
horizontally disposed in a metallic box, <span class='fss'>B B B B</span>, connected

box, <span class='fss'>C C C C</span>, connected
with the
plate <span class='fss'>P′ P′</span>, acts
upon the air of
the condenser
across a metallic
sheet, <span class='fss'>T</span>; the
rays which pass
through the
sheet are alone
utilised for producing
the current,
the electric
field being
limited by the
sheet. The distance,
<span class='fss'>A T</span>, of the
active body from
the sheet may be varied. The field between the plates is
established by means of a battery. By placing in <span class='fss'>A</span> upon the
active body different screens, and by adjusting the distance
<span class='fss'>A T</span>, the absorption of rays which travel long or short distances
in the air may be determined.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a certain value of the distance <span class='fss'>A T</span> (4 c.m. and more),

When the distance <span class='fss'>A T</span> is diminished, the appearance of the

weak current changing to one of considerable strength for

<p class='c010'>In these experiments the distance of the plates, <span class='fss'>P</span> and <span class='fss'>P′</span>,
was 3 c.m. We see that the interposition of the
aluminium screen diminishes the intensity of the radiation
to a greater degree at further distances than at nearer
distances.</p>

<p class='c010'>This effect is still more marked than the preceding
figures seem to indicate. For a distance of 0·5 c.m. 25
per cent represents the mean penetration for all the rays
which pass beyond this distance. If, for example, only
those rays between 0·5 c.m. and 1 c.m. be comprehended,
the penetration would be greater. And if the plate <span class='fss'>P</span> be
placed at a distance of 0·5 c.m. from <span class='fss'>P′</span> the fraction of the
radiation transmitted by the aluminium lamina (for <span class='fss'>A T</span> = 0·5
c.m.) is 47 per cent, and through two laminæ it is 5 per
cent of the original radiation.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have recently performed a second series of experiments
with these same specimens of polonium, the activity of
which was considerably diminished, the interval of time

<p class='c010'>I also found that the fraction of the radiation absorbed
by a given screen increases with the thickness of the
material already traversed by the radiation, but this only
occurs after the distance <span class='fss'>A T</span> has reached a certain value.
When this distance is zero (the polonium being in contact
with the sheet, either outside or inside the condenser), it is
observed that with several similar superposed screens, each
absorbs the same fraction of the radiation it receives;
otherwise expressed, the intensity of the radiation diminishes
therefore according to an exponential law as a function of
the thickness of the material traversed, as in the case
of homogeneous radiation transmitted by the lamina without
changing its nature.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following numerical results are given with reference
to these experiments:—</p>

<p class='c010'>For a distance <span class='fss'>A T</span> equal to 1·5 c.m. a thin aluminium
screen transmits the fraction 0·51 of the radiation it receives
when acting alone, and the fraction 0·34 of the radiation it
receives when it is preceded by another similar screen.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the contrary, for a distance <span class='fss'>A T</span> equal to zero, the
same screen transmits in both the cases considered the same
fraction of the radiation it receives, and this fraction is equal
to 0·71; it is therefore greater than in the preceding case.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following numbers indicate for a distance <span class='fss'>A T</span> equal
to 0 and for a succession of thin superposed screens, the
ratio of the radiation transmitted to the radiation received

<p class='c010'>The rays which travel furthest in the air are those most
absorbed by the aluminium. There is therefore a great
similarity between the absorbable α-rays of radium and the
rays of polonium.</p>

<p class='c010'>The deflected β-rays and the undeflected penetrating γ-rays
are, on the contrary, of a different nature. The experiments,
notably of MM. Meyer and von Schweidler,
clearly show that, considering the radiation of radium as a
whole, the penetrating power of this radiation increases
with the thickness of the material traversed, as is the case
of Röntgen rays. In these experiments the α-rays produce
scarcely any effect, being for the most part suppressed by
very thin absorbent screens. Those which penetrate are,
on the one hand, β-rays more or less scattered; on the
other hand, γ-rays, which appear similar to Röntgen rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following are the results of some of my experiments
on the subject:—</p>

<p class='c010'>The radium is enclosed in a glass vessel. The rays,
which emerge from the vessel, traverse 30 c.m. of air, and
are received upon a series of glass plates, each of thickness
1·3 m.m.; the first plate transmits 49 per cent of the radiation
it receives, the second transmits 84 per cent of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>radiation it receives, the third transmits 85 per cent of the
radiation it receives.</p>

<p class='c010'>In another series of experiments the radium was enclosed
in a glass vessel placed 10 c.m. from the condenser which
received the rays. A series of similar screens of lead each
0·115 m.m. thick were placed on the vessel.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ratio of the radiation transmitted to the radiation
received is given for each of the successive screens by the
following numbers:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>0·40 0·60 0·72 0·79 0·89 0·92 0·94 0·94 0·97</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>For a series of four screens of lead, each of which was
1·5 m.m. thick, the ratio of the radiation transmitted to the
radiation received was given for the successive screens by
the following numbers:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>0·09 0·78 0·84 0·82</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The results of these experiments show that when the
thickness of the lead traversed increases from 0·1 m.m. to
6 m.m., the penetrating power of the radiation increases.</p>

<p class='c010'>I found that, under the experimental conditions mentioned,
a screen of lead 1·8 c.m. thick transmits 2 per cent
of the radiation it receives; a screen of lead 5·3 c.m. thick
transmits 0·4 per cent of the radiation it receives. I also
found that the radiation transmitted by a thickness of lead
of 1·5 m.m. consists largely of rays capable of deflection
(cathode order). The latter are therefore capable of
traversing not only great distances in the air, but also considerable
thicknesses of very absorbent solids, such as lead.</p>

<p class='c010'>In investigating with the apparatus of Fig. 2 the absorption
exercised by an aluminium screen 0·01 m.m. thick
upon the total radiation of radium, the screen being always
placed at the same distance from the radiating body, and
the condenser being placed at a variable distance, <span class='fss'>A D</span>, the
results obtained are the sum of those due to the three
groups of the radiation. At a long distance the penetrating
rays predominate, and the absorption is slight; at a short
distance the α-rays predominate, and the absorption becomes
less with nearer approach to the substance; for an
intermediate distance the absorption passes through a
maximum and the penetration through a minimum.</p>

<p class='c010'>Certain experiments made in connection with absorption
always demonstrate a certain similarity between the α-rays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and the β-rays. Thus it was that M. Becquerel discovered
that the absorbent action of a solid screen upon the β-rays
increases with the distance of the screen from the source,
such that if the rays are subjected to a magnetic field, as
in Fig. 4, a screen placed in contact with the source of
radiation allows a larger portion of the magnetic spectrum
to be in evidence than does the same screen placed upon
the photographic plate. This variation of the absorbent
effect of the screen with the distance of the screen from the
source is similar to that which occurs with the α-rays; this
has been verified by MM. Meyer and von Schweidler, who
operated by means of the fluoroscopic method; M. Curie
and I observed the same fact when working by the
electrical method. However, when the radium is enclosed
in a glass tube and placed at a distance from the condenser,
which is itself enclosed in a thin aluminium box, it becomes
a matter of indifference whether the screen be placed
against the source or against the condenser; the current
obtained is the same in both cases.</p>

<p class='c010'>The investigation of the α-rays led me to the reflection
that these rays behave like projectiles having a certain
initial velocity, and which lose their force on encountering
obstacles. These rays, moreover, travel by rectilinear
propagation, as has been shown by M. Becquerel in the
following experiment:—Polonium emitting rays was
placed in a very narrow straight cavity hollowed in a sheet
of cardboard. Thus a linear source of radiation was produced.
A copper wire, 1·5 m.m. in diameter, was placed
parallel and opposite to the source at a distance of 4·9 m.m.
Beyond was placed a parallel photographic plate at a distance
of 8·65 m.m. After an exposure of ten minutes, the
geometric shadow of the wire was perfectly reproduced,
with a narrow penumbra corresponding to the size of the
source. The same experiment succeeded equally well
when a double leaf of beaten aluminium was placed against
the wire, through which the rays must pass.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are therefore rays capable of giving perfect
geometric shadows. The experiment with the aluminium
shows that these rays are not scattered in traversing the
screen, and that this screen does not give rise to any
noticeable extent to secondary rays similar to the secondary
rays of the Röntgen rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>The experiments of Mr. Rutherford show that the projectiles
which constitute the α-rays are deflected by a
magnetic field, as if they were positively charged. The
deflection in a magnetic field becomes less as the product
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span><span class='fraction'><i>mv</i><br /><span class='vincula'><i>e</i></span></span> becomes greater; <i>m</i> being the mass of the particle, <i>v</i>
its velocity, and <i>e</i> its charge. The cathode rays of radium
are but slightly deflected, because their velocity is
enormous; they are, on the other hand, very penetrating,
because each particle has a very small mass together with
a great velocity. But particles which, with an equal
charge and a less velocity, have a greater mass, would be
also only slightly influenced by the action of the field, and
would give rise to very absorbable rays. From the results
of Mr. Rutherford’s experiments, this seems to take place in
the case of the α-rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>The penetrating γ-rays appear to be of quite another
nature and similar to Röntgen rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have now seen how complex a phenomenon is the
radiation of radio-active bodies. The difficulties of investigation
are increased by the question as to whether the
radiation undergoes a merely selective absorption on the
part of the material, or whether a more or less radical
transformation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Little is so far known with regard to this question. If
the radiation of radium be regarded as containing rays both
of the cathode and Röntgen species, it might be expected
to undergo transformations in traversing screens. It is
known:—Firstly, that cathode rays emerging from a
Crookes tube through an aluminium window are greatly
scattered by the aluminium; and, further, that the passage
through the screen entails a diminution of the velocity of
the rays. In this way, cathode rays with a velocity equal
to 1·4 × 10<sup>10</sup> c.m. lose 10 per cent of their velocity in
passing through 0·01 m.m. of aluminium. Secondly,
cathode rays on striking an obstacle give rise to the production
of Röntgen rays. Thirdly, Röntgen rays, on
striking a solid obstacle, give rise to the production of
<i>secondary rays</i>, which partly consist of cathode rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>The existence, by analogy, of all these preceding phenomena
may therefore be predicted for the rays of radio-active
substances.</p>

<p class='c010'>In investigating the transmission of polonium rays
through a screen of aluminium, M. Becquerel observed
neither the production of secondary rays nor any transformation
into cathode rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>I endeavoured to demonstrate a transformation of the
rays of polonium by using the method of interchangeable
screens. Two superposed screens, <span class='fss'>E</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class='fss'>E</span><sub>2</sub>, being
traversed by the rays, the order in which they are traversed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>should be immaterial if the passage through the screens
does not transform the rays; if, on the contrary, each
screen transforms the rays during transmission, the order
of the screens is of moment. If, for example, the rays are
transformed into more absorbable rays in passing through
lead, and no such effect is produced by aluminium, then
the system lead-aluminium will be more opaque than the
system aluminium-lead; this takes place with Röntgen
rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>My experiments show that this phenomenon is produced
with the rays of polonium. The apparatus employed was
that of Fig. 8. The polonium was placed in the box,
<span class='fss'>C C C C</span>, and the absorbing screens, of necessity very thin,
were placed upon the metallic sheet T.</p>

<p class='c010'>The results obtained prove that the radiation is modified
in passing through a solid screen. This conclusion accords
with the experiments in which, of two similar superposed
metallic screens, the first is less absorbent than the second.
From this it is probable that the transforming action of a
screen increases with the distance of the screen from the
source. This fact has not been verified, and the nature of
the transformation has not been studied in detail.</p>

<p class='c010'>I repeated the same experiments with a very active salt
of radium; the result was negative. I only observed
insignificant variations in the intensity of the radiation
transmitted with interchange of the order of the screens.

<p class='c010'>The system lead-aluminium was slightly more opaque
than the system aluminium-lead, but the difference was not
great.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus, I was unable to discover an appreciable transformation
of the rays of radium. However, in various radiographic
experiments, M. Becquerel observed very intense
effects due to scattered or secondary rays, emitted by solid
screens which received radium rays. Lead seemed to be
the most active substance in this respect.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Ionising Action of Radium Rays on Insulating Liquids.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>M. Curie has pointed out that radium rays and Röntgen
rays act upon liquid dielectrics as upon air, imparting to
them a certain electrical conductivity. The experiment
was carried out in the following manner (Fig. 9):—</p>

<p class='c010'>The experimental liquid is placed in a metal vessel,
<span class='fss'>C D E F</span>, into which a thin copper tube, <span class='fss'>A B</span>, is plunged;
these two pieces of metal serve as electrodes. The outer
vessel is maintained at a known potential, by means of a
battery of small accumulators, one pole of which is connected
to earth. The tube, <span class='fss'>A B</span>, is connected to the electrometer.
When a current traverses the liquid the electrometer
is kept at zero by means of a quartz electrical
piezometer, which gives the strength of the current. The
copper tube, <span class='fss'>M N M′ N′</span>, connected to earth, serves as a
guard tube, preventing the passage of the current through
the air. A bulb containing the radium-barium salt may be
placed at the bottom of the tube, <span class='fss'>A B</span>; the rays act on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>liquid after having penetrated the glass of the bulb and the
sides of the metal tube. The radium may also be allowed
to act by placing the bulb beneath the side, <span class='fss'>D E</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In working with Röntgen rays the course of the rays is
through side <span class='fss'>D E</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The increase of conductivity by the action of the radium
rays or the Röntgen rays seems to be produced in the case
of all liquid dielectrics; but in order to determine this increase,
the conductivity of the liquid itself must be so slight
as not to mask the effect of the rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Curie obtained results of the same order of magnitude
with both radium rays and Röntgen rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>When investigating with the same apparatus the conductivity
of air or of another gas under the action of the
Becquerel rays, the intensity of
the current obtained is found to
be proportional to the difference of
potential between the electrodes,
as long as the latter does not
exceed a few volts; but at higher
tensions, the intensity of the
current increases less and less
rapidly, and the saturation current
is practically attained for a
tension of 100 volts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Liquids examined with the
same apparatus and the same
radio-active body behave differently;
the intensity of the current
is proportional to the tension
when the latter varies between 0
and 450 volts, and when the distance
between the electrodes does
not exceed 6 m.m.</p>

</table>

<p class='c010'>We may, however, assume that liquids and gases behave
similarly, but that, in the case of liquids, the current remains
proportional to the tension up to a much higher limit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>than in the case of gases. It therefore seemed probable
that the limit of proportionality could be lowered by using
a much more feeble radiation, and this idea was verified by
experiment. The radio-active body employed was 150
times less active than that which had served for the previous
experiments. For tensions of 50, 100, 200, 400 volts, the
intensities of the current were represented respectively by
the numbers 109, 185, 255, 335. The proportionality was
no longer maintained, but the current showed great
variation when the difference of potential was doubled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the liquids examined are nearly perfect insulators
when maintained at a constant temperature and
when screened from the action of the rays. Such are
liquid air, petroleum ether, vaseline oil, and amylene. It
is therefore very easy to study the effect of the rays.
Vaseline oil is much less sensitive to the action of the rays
than is petroleum ether. This fact may have some relation
to the difference in volatility which exists between these
two hydrocarbons. Liquid air, which has boiled for some
time in the experimental vessel, is more sensitive to the
action of the rays than that newly poured in; the conductivity
produced by the rays is one-fourth as great again
in the former case. M. Curie has investigated the action
of the rays upon amylene and upon petroleum ether at
temperatures of +10° and –17°. The conductivity due to
the radiation diminishes by one-tenth of its value only, in
passing from 10° to –17°.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the experiments in which the temperature of the
liquid is varied, the temperature of the radium may be
either that of the surrounding atmosphere or that of the
liquid; the same result is obtained in both cases. This
leads to the conclusion that the radiation of radium does
not vary with the temperature, and remains unaltered even
at the temperature of liquid air. This fact has been verified
directly by measurements.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Various Effects and Applications of the Ionising Action of the Rays Emitted by Radio-active Substances.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The rays of the new radio-active substances have a
strongly ionising action upon air. By the action of radium
<i>the condensation of supersaturated water vapour</i> can be easily
induced, just as happens by the action of cathode rays
and Röntgen rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under the influence of the rays emitted by the new radio-active
substances, <i>the distance of discharge between two
metallic conductors for a given difference of potential is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>increased</i>; to put it otherwise, the passage of the spark
is facilitated by these rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>In causing conductivity, by the action of radio-active
bodies, in the air in the neighbourhood of two metallic conductors,
one of which is connected to earth and the other to
a well-insulated electrometer, the electrometer is seen to be
permanently deflected, which gives a measure of the
electromotive force of the battery formed by the air and the
two metals (electromotive force of contact of the two
metals, when they are separated by air). This method of
measurement was employed by Lord Kelvin and his
students, the radiating body being uranium; a similar
method had been previously employed by M. Perrin, who
was using the ionising action of Röntgen rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>Radio-active bodies may be employed in the study of
atmospheric electricity. The active substance is enclosed
in a little box of thin aluminium fixed at the extremity of a
metal wire connected with the electrometer. The air is
made to conduct in the neighbourhood of the end of the
wire, and the latter adopts the potential of the surrounding
air. Radium thus replaces, with advantage, the flames or
the apparatus of running water of Lord Kelvin, till now in
general use for the investigation of atmospheric electricity.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Fluorescent and Luminous Effects.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The rays emitted by the new radio-active bodies cause
fluorescence of certain substances. M. Curie and myself
first discovered this phenomenon when causing polonium
to act upon a layer of barium platinocyanide through
aluminium foil. The same experiment succeeds yet more
easily with barium containing radium. When the substance
is strongly radio-active the fluorescence produced is
very beautiful.</p>

<p class='c010'>A large number of bodies are capable of becoming
phosphorescent or fluorescent by the action of the Becquerel
rays. M. Becquerel studied the effect upon the uranium
salts, the diamond, &amp;c. M. Bary has demonstrated that
the salts of the metals of the alkalis and alkaline earths,
which are all fluorescent under the action of luminous rays
and Röntgen rays, are also fluorescent under the action of
the rays of radium. Paper, cotton, glass, &amp;c., are all
caused to fluoresce in the neighbourhood of radium.
Among the different kinds of glass, Thuringian glass is
specially luminous. Metals do not seem to become
luminous.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barium platinocyanide is most conveniently used when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the radiation of the radio-active bodies is to be investigated
by the fluoroscopic method. The effect of the radium rays
may be followed at distances greater than 2 m. Phosphorescent
zinc sulphide is made extremely luminous, but
this body has the inconvenient property of preserving its
luminosity for some time after the action of the rays has
ceased.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fluorescence produced by radium may be observed
when the fluorescent screen is separated from the radium
by absorbent screens. We were able to observe the
illumination of a screen of barium platinocyanide across
the human body. However, the action is incomparably
greater when the screen is placed immediately in contact
with the radium, being separated from it by no solid screen
at all. All the groups of rays appear capable of producing
fluorescence.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order to observe the action of polonium, the substance
must be placed close to the fluorescent screen, without the
intervention of a solid screen, unless the latter be extremely
thin.</p>

<p class='c010'>The luminosity of fluorescent substances exposed to the
action of radio-active bodies diminishes with time. At the
same time the fluorescent substance undergoes a transformation.
The following are examples:—</p>

<p class='c010'>Radium rays transform barium platinocyanide into a
brown, less luminous variety (an action similar to that
produced by Röntgen rays, and described by M. Villard).
Uranium sulphate and potassium sulphate are similarly
altered. The changed barium platinocyanide is partially
regenerated by the action of light. If the radium be placed
beneath a layer of barium platinocyanide spread on paper,
the platinocyanide becomes luminous; if the system be kept
in the dark, the platinocyanide becomes changed, and its
luminosity diminishes considerably. But if the whole be
exposed to light, the platinocyanide is partially regenerated,
and if the whole is replaced in darkness the luminosity reappears
with vigour. By means of a fluorescent body and
a radio-active body, we have therefore obtained a system
which acts as a phosphorescent body capable of long duration
of phosphorescence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Glass made fluorescent by the action of radium becomes
coloured brown or violet. At the same time its fluorescence
diminishes. If the glass thus changed be warmed, it is
decolorised, and when this occurs the glass becomes
luminous. The glass has now regained its fluorescent
property in the same degree as before the transformation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Zinc sulphide, which has been exposed for a sufficient
length of time to the action of radium, gradually becomes
used up, and loses its phosphorescent property, whether
under the action of radium or that of light.</p>

<p class='c010'>The diamond becomes phosphorescent under the action
of radium, and may thus be distinguished from paste
imitations, which have only a very faint luminosity.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the barium-radium compounds <i>are spontaneously
luminous</i>. The dry anhydrous halogen salts emit a particularly
intense light. This illumination cannot be seen
in broad daylight, but it is easily visible in the twilight or
by gas-light. The light emitted may be strong enough to
read by in the dark. The light emitted emanates from the
entire body of the product, whilst in the case of a common
phosphorescent body, the light emanates specially from
the portion of the surface illuminated. Radium products
lose much of their luminosity in damp air, but they regain
it on drying (Giesel). There is apparently conservation of
luminosity. After many years no sensible modification is
produced in the luminosity of feebly active products, kept
in the dark in sealed tubes. In the case of very active and
very luminous radium-barium chloride, the light changes
colour after several months; it becomes more violet and
loses in intensity; at the same time the product undergoes
transformations; on re-dissolving the salt in water
and drying it afresh, the original luminosity is restored.</p>

<p class='c010'>Solutions of barium-radium salts, which contain a large
proportion of radium, are equally luminous; this fact may
be observed by placing the solution in a platinum capsule,
which not being itself luminous permits of the faint
luminosity of the solution being seen.</p>

<p class='c010'>When a solution of a barium-radium salt contains crystals
deposited in it, these crystals are luminous at the bottom of
the solution, and much more so than the solution itself, so
that they alone appear luminous.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Giesel has made a preparation of barium-radium
platinocyanide. When this salt is newly crystallised, it
has the appearance of ordinary barium platinocyanide
and is very luminous. But gradually the salt becomes
spontaneously coloured, taking a brown tint, the crystals at
the same time becoming dichroic. In this state the salt is
much less luminous, although its radio-activity is increased.
The radium platinocyanide, prepared by M. Giesel, changes
still more rapidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Radium compounds are the first example of self-luminous
bodies.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
  <h3 class='c011'><i>Evolution of Heat by the Salts of Radium.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>MM. Curie and Laborde have recently discovered that
<i>the salts of radium are the source of a spontaneous and continuous
evolution of heat</i>. This evolution has the effect of
keeping the salts of radium at a temperature higher than
that of their surroundings; an excess of temperature of
1·5° has been observed. This excess of temperature is
dependent upon the thermal insulation of the body. MM.
Curie and Laborde have determined the amount of heat
produced in the case of radium. They found that the output
is of the order of magnitude of 100 calories per grm. of
radium per hour. One grm.-atom (225 grm.) of radium
give rise in one hour to 22,500 cal., a quantity of heat
comparable to that produced by the combustion of 1 grm.-atom
(1 grm.) of hydrogen. So great an evolution of heat
can be explained by no ordinary chemical reaction, more
particularly as the condition of the radium remains unaffected
for years. The evolution of heat might be attributed
to a slow transformation of the radium atom. If this were
the case, we should be led to conclude that the quantities
of energy generated during the formation and transformation
of the atoms are considerable, and that they
exceed all that is so far known.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Chemical Effects produced by the New Radio-active Bodies.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'><i>Colourations.</i>—The radiations of strongly radio-active
bodies are capable of causing certain chemical reactions.
The rays emitted by radium products exercise colouring
actions upon glass and porcelain.</p>

<p class='c010'>The colouration of glass, generally brown or violet, is
very deep; it is produced in the body of the glass, and
remains after removal of the radium. All glasses become
coloured after a longer or a shorter interval of time, and the
presence of lead is not essential. This fact may be compared
to that recently observed of the colouration of the
glass of vacuum tubes, after having been long in use for the
production of Röntgen rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Giesel has demonstrated that the crystallised halogen
salts of the alkali metals become coloured under the influence
of radium, as under the action of cathode rays. M.
Giesel points out that similar colourations are obtained
when the salts of the alkalis are exposed to sodium vapour.</p>

<p class='c010'>I investigated the colouration of a collection of glasses
of known composition, kindly lent me for the occasion
by M. Le Chatelier. I observed no great variety in the
colouration. It is generally brown, violet, yellow, or grey.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>It appears to be associated with the presence of the alkali
metals.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the pure crystallised alkali salts more varied and
more vivid colours are obtained; the salt, originally white,
becomes blue, green, yellow, brown, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Becquerel has discovered that yellow phosphorus is
transformed into the red variety by the action of radium.</p>

<p class='c010'>Paper is changed and coloured by the action of radium.
It becomes brittle, scorched, and, finally, resembles a
colander perforated with holes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under some circumstances there is a production of ozone
in the neighbourhood of very active compounds. Rays
emerging from a sealed jar containing radium do not produce
ozone in the air they pass through. On the contrary,
a strong odour of ozone is detected when the jar is opened.
In a general way, ozone is produced in the air when the
latter is in direct contact with the radium. Communication
by a channel, even if extremely narrow, suffices; it
appears as if the production of ozone is associated with the
propagation of induced radio-activity, of which we shall
speak later.</p>

<p class='c010'>Radium compounds appear to change with lapse of time,
doubtless under the action of their own radiation. It was
seen above that crystals of barium-radium chloride, which
are colourless when formed, become gradually coloured
first yellow or orange, then pink; this colouration disappears
in solution. Barium-radium chloride generates
oxygen compounds of chlorine; the bromide those of
bromine. These slow changes generally manifest themselves
some time after the preparation of the solid product,
which at the same time changes in form and colour,
becoming yellow or violet. The light emitted also becomes
more violet.</p>

<p class='c010'>A solution of a radium salt evolves hydrogen (Giesel).</p>

<p class='c010'>Pure radium salts seem to undergo the same changes
as those containing barium. However, crystals of the
chloride, deposited in acid solution, do not become sensibly
coloured after some time has elapsed, whereas crystals of
barium-radium chloride, rich in radium, become deeply
coloured.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Production of Thermo-luminosity.</i>—Certain bodies, such
as fluorite, become luminous when heated; they are
thermo-luminescent. Their luminosity disappears after
some time, but the capacity of becoming luminous afresh
through heat is restored to them by the action of a spark,
and also by the action of radium. Radium can thus restore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>to these bodies their thermo-luminescent property. Fluorite
when heated undergoes a change, which is accompanied by
the emission of light. If the fluorite is afterwards subjected
to the action of radium, an inverse change occurs, which is
also accompanied by an emission of light.</p>

<p class='c010'>An absolutely similar phenomenon occurs when glass is
exposed to radium rays. Here also a change is produced
in the glass while luminous from the effect of the radium
rays; this change shows itself in the colouration which
appears and gradually increases. If the glass is afterwards
heated, the inverse change takes place, the colour disappears,
and this phenomenon is accompanied by production
of light. It appears very probable that we have
here a change of a chemical nature, and the production of
light is associated with this change. This phenomenon may
be general. It might be that the production of fluorescence
by the action of radium and the luminosity of radium compounds
is of necessity associated with some chemical or
physical change in the substance emitting the light.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Radiographs.</i>—The radiographic action of the new radio-active
bodies is very marked. However, the method of
operating should be very different with polonium and
radium. Polonium acts only at very short distances, and
its action is considerably weakened by solid screens; it is
practically annihilated by means of a screen of slight thickness
(1 m.m. of glass). Radium acts at considerably
greater distances. The radiographic action of radium rays
may be observed at more than 2 m. distance in air, even
when the active product is enclosed in a glass vessel. The
rays acting under these conditions belong to the β- and
γ-groups. Owing to the differences in transparency of
different materials to the rays, radiographs of different
objects may be obtained, as in the case of Röntgen rays.
Metals are, as a rule, opaque, with the exception of
aluminium, which is very transparent. There is no noteworthy
difference of transparency between flesh and bone.
The operation may be carried on at a great distance and
with a source of very small dimensions; and very delicate
radiographs are thus produced. The beauty of the radiograph
is enhanced by deflecting to one side the β-rays,
by means of a magnetic field, and utilising only the γ-rays.
The β-rays, in traversing the object to be radiographed,
undergo a certain amount of diffusion, and thus cause a
slight fog. In suppressing them, a longer time of exposure
is necessary, but better results are obtained. The radiograph
of an object, such as a purse, requires one day with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>radiating source composed of several centigrams of a radium
salt, enclosed in a glass vessel, and placed at a distance of
1 m. from the sensitive plate, in front of which the object is
placed. If the source is at a distance of 20 c.m. from the
plate, the same result is obtained in one hour. In the
immediate vicinity of the source of radiation, a sensitive
plate is instantaneously acted upon.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Physiological Effects.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>Radium rays exert an action upon the epidermis. This
has been observed by M. Walkhoff and confirmed by
M. Giesel, since also by MM. Becquerel and Curie.</p>

<p class='c010'>If a celluloid or thin indiarubber capsule containing a very
active salt of radium be placed upon the skin, and be left
thus for some time, a redness is produced upon the skin,
either immediately or at the end of some time, which is
longer in proportion as the action is weaker; this red spot
appears in the place which has been exposed to the action;
the local change in the skin appears and acts like a burn.
In certain cases a blister is formed. If the exposure was of
long duration, an ulceration is produced which is long in
healing. In one experiment, M. Curie caused a relatively
weak radio-active product to act upon his arm for ten hours.
The redness appeared immediately, and later a wound was
caused which took four months to heal. The epidermis
was locally destroyed, and formed again slowly and with
difficulty, leaving a very marked scar. A radium burn with
half-an-hour’s exposure appeared after fifteen days, formed
a blister and healed in fifteen days. Another burn, caused
by an exposure of only eight minutes, occasioned a red spot
which appeared two months after, its effect being quite
insignificant.</p>

<p class='c010'>The action of radium upon the skin can take place across
metal screens, but with weakened effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>The action of radium upon the skin has been investigated
by Dr. Daulos, at the Hospital of St. Louis, as a process of
treating certain affections of the skin, similar to the treatment
with the Röntgen rays or the ultra-violet rays. In
this respect radium gives encouraging results; the epidermis
partially destroyed by the action of the radium is renewed
in a healthy condition. The action of radium is more
penetrating than that of light, and its use is easier than that
of light or of Röntgen rays. The study of the conditions
of application is of necessity rather lengthy, because the
effect of the application does not at once appear.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Giesel has observed the action of radium upon plant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>leaves. The leaves thus treated turn yellow and wither
away.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Giesel has also discovered the action of radium rays
upon the eye. If a radio-active substance be placed in the
dark in the vicinity of the closed eye or of the temple,
a sensation of light fills the eye. This phenomenon has been
studied by MM. Himstedt and Nagel. These physicists
have demonstrated that the centre of the eye is rendered
fluorescent by the action of radium, and this explains the
sensation of light experienced. Blind people whose retina
is intact are sensitive to the action of radium, whilst those
whose retina is diseased do not experience any sensation of
luminosity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Radium rays either arrest or hinder the development of
colonies of microbes, but this action is not very intense.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Danysz has recently demonstrated the ready action
of radium upon the marrow and brain. After one hour’s
exposure paralysis of the animals experimented upon
occurred, and the latter usually died in a few days.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Influence of Temperature upon Radiation.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>There is so far but little information regarding the
manner of variation of the radiation of radio-active bodies
with temperature. We know, however, that radiation
subsists at low temperatures. M. Curie placed a glass tube
containing barium-radium chloride in liquid air. The
luminosity of the radio-active body persisted under these
conditions. At the moment, indeed, of removing the tube
from the cold bath, it appears more luminous than at the
ordinary temperature. At the temperature of liquid air
radium continues to cause fluorescence in the sulphates of
uranium and potassium. M. Curie has verified, by electrical
determinations, that the radiation, measured at a certain
distance from the source, possesses the same intensity
whether the radium be at the temperature of the atmosphere
or of liquid air. In these experiments the radium was
placed at the bottom of a tube closed at one end. The
rays emerged from the tube at the open end, traversed a
certain space in the air, and were received into a condenser.
The action of the rays upon the air of the condenser was
determined both on leaving the tube in the air and on surrounding
it to a certain height with liquid air. The same
result was obtained in both cases.</p>

<p class='c010'>The radio-activity of radium persists at high temperatures.
Barium-radium chloride after being fused (towards 800°) is
radio-active and luminous. However, prolonged heating at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>a high temperature has the effect of temporarily lowering
the radio-activity of the body. This decrease is very considerable;
it may constitute 75 per cent of the total radiation.
The decrease is less in proportion for the absorbable
rays than for the penetrating rays, which are to some
extent suppressed by heating. In time the radiation of the
product regains the intensity and composition that it
possessed before heating; this occurs after the lapse of
about two months from the occasion of heating.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Communication of Radio-activity to Substances Initially Inactive.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>During the course of our researches on radio-active substances
M. Curie and I have observed that every substance
which remains for some time in the vicinity of a radium salt
becomes itself radio-active. In our first publication on this
subject, we confined ourselves to proving that the radio-activity
thus acquired by substances initially inactive is not
due to the transference of radio-active particles to the
surface of these substances. This is proved beyond dispute by
all the experiments which will be here described, and by the
laws according to which the radio-activity excited in
naturally inactive bodies disappears when the latter are
removed from the influence of radium.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have given the name of <i>induced radio-activity</i> to the
new phenomenon thus discovered.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the same publication, we indicated the essential
characteristics of induced radio-activity. We excited
screens of different substances by placing them in the
neighbourhood of solid radium salts, and we investigated
the radio-activity of these screens by the electrical method.
We observed the following facts:—</p>

<p class='c010'>1. The activity of a screen exposed to the action of
radium increases with the time of exposure, approaching to
a definite limit according to an asymptotic law.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. The activity of a screen which has been excited by the
action of radium, and which is afterwards withdrawn from
its action, disappears in a few days. This induced activity
approaches zero as a function of the time, following an
asymptotic law.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Other things being equal, the radio-activity induced
by the same radium product upon different screens is independent
of the nature of the screen. Glass, paper,
metals, all acquire the same degree of activity.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>4. The radio-activity induced in one screen by differing
radium products has a limiting value which rises with the
increased activity of the product.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shortly afterwards, Mr. Rutherford published a research,
which showed that compounds of thorium are capable of
producing the phenomenon of induced radio-activity. Mr.
Rutherford discovered for this phenomenon the same laws as
those just enunciated, besides this additional important fact,
that bodies charged with negative electricity become more
active than others. Mr. Rutherford also observed that air
passed over thorium oxide preserves a notable conductivity
for about ten minutes. Air in this condition communicates
induced radio-activity to inactive substances, especially to
those negatively charged. Mr. Rutherford explains his experiences
by the supposition that compounds of thorium,
particularly the oxide, give rise to a <i>radio-active emanation</i>
capable of being carried by air currents and charged with
positive electricity. This emanation would be the origin
of induced radio-activity. M. Dorn has repeated, with
salts of barium containing radium, the experiments of Mr.
Rutherford with thorium oxide.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Debierne has shown that actinium causes, to a
marked degree, induced activity of bodies placed in its
vicinity. As in the case of thorium, there is a considerable
carriage of activity by air currents.</p>

<p class='c010'>Induced radio-activity has various aspects, and irregular
results are obtained when the activity of a substance in the
neighbourhood of radium is excited in free air. MM. Curie
and Debierne have observed, however, that the phenomenon
is quite regular when operating in a closed vessel; they
therefore investigated induced activity in a closed space.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Activity Induced in an Enclosed Space.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The active material is placed in a little glass jar, <i>a</i>, open
at <span class='fss'>O</span> (Fig. 11), in the centre of a closed space. Several
plates, <span class='fss'>A</span>, <span class='fss'>B</span>, <span class='fss'>C</span>, <span class='fss'>D</span>, <span class='fss'>E</span>, placed in the enclosure become radio-active
after one day’s exposure. The activity is the same
whatever be the nature of the plate, for equal dimensions
(lead, copper, aluminium, glass, ebonite, wax, cardboard,
paraffin). The activity of one face of one of the plates is
greater in proportion to the amount of free space about this
face.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the preceding experiment be repeated with the jar, <i>a</i>,
completely closed, no activity is induced.</p>

<p class='c010'>The radiation of radium does not directly affect the production
of induced radio-activity. For this reason, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>preceding experiment the plate <span class='fss'>D</span>, screened from the radiation
by a lead plate of thickness, <span class='fss'>P P</span>, is made as active as
<span class='fss'>B</span> and <span class='fss'>E</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Radio-activity is transmitted by the air by degrees from
the radiating body to the body to be excited. It can even
be transmitted to a distance by very narrow capillary tubes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Induced radio-activity is both
more intense and more regular
if the solid radium salt be replaced
by an aqueous solution
of the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>Liquids are capable of acquiring
induced radio-activity.
For example, pure water may
be rendered active by placing
it with a solution of a radium
salt within an enclosure.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/f_11.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 11</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Certain substances become
luminous when placed in an active enclosure (phosphorescent
and fluorescent bodies, glass, paper, cotton, water,
salt solutions). Phosphorescent zinc sulphide is particularly
brilliant under the circumstances. The radio-activity of
these luminous bodies is, however, the same as that of a
piece of a metal or other body which is excited under the
same conditions without becoming luminous.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whatever be the substance made active in a closed vessel,
this substance acquires an activity which increases with
length of time until it attains a <i>limiting value</i>, always the
same, for the same material and the same experimental
arrangement.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The limit of induced radio-activity is independent of the nature
and pressure of the gas inside the active enclosure</i> (air, hydrogen,
carbonic acid).</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The limit of induced radio-activity for the same enclosure
depends only on the quantity of radium present</i> in the state of
solution, and is apparently proportional to it.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Part played by Gases in the Phenomena of Induced Radio-activity.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'><i>Emanation.</i>—The gases present in an enclosure containing
a solid salt or a solution of a salt of radium are radio-active.
This radio-activity persists when the gas is drawn off with a
tube and collected in a test-tube. The sides of the test-tube
become themselves radio-active, and the glass of the test-tube
is luminous in the dark. The activity and luminosity
of the test-tube finally completely disappear, but very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>gradually, and a month afterwards radio-activity may still
be detected.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the beginning of our researches, M. Curie and I
have, by heating pitchblende, extracted a strongly radio-active
gas, but, as in the preceding experiment, the activity
of this gas finally completely vanished.</p>

<p class='c010'>We could discern no new ray in the spectrum of this gas;
this was therefore not a case of a new radio-active gas, and
we understood later that it was the phenomenon of induced
radio-activity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus, for thorium, radium, and actinium induced radio-activity
is progressively propagated through the gases, from
the radiating body to the walls of the enclosure containing
it, and the exciting principle is carried away with the gas
itself, when the latter is extracted from the enclosure.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the radio-activity of radium compounds is measured
by the electrical method by means of the apparatus of
Fig. 1, the air between the plates is itself radio-active;
however, on passing a current of air between the plates,
there is no observable lowering of the intensity of the
current, which proves that the radio-activity distributed in
the space between the plates is of little account in comparison
with that of the radium itself in the solid state.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is quite otherwise with thorium. The irregularities
which I observed in determining the radio-activity of the
thorium compounds arose from the fact that at this point I
was working with a condenser open to the air; the least air
current caused a considerable change in the intensity of the
current, because the radio-activity dispersed in the space in
the vicinity of the thorium is considerable as compared with
the radio-activity of the substance.</p>

<p class='c010'>This effect is still more marked in the case of actinium.
A very active compound of actinium appears much less
active when a current of air is passed over the substance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The radio-active energy is therefore contained in the gas
in a special form. Mr. Rutherford suggests that radio-active
bodies generate an <i>emanation</i> or gaseous material
which carries the radio-activity. In the opinion of M. Curie
and myself, the generation of a gas by radium is a supposition
which is not so far justified. We consider the
emanation as radio-active energy stored up in the gas in a
form hitherto unknown.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Dissipation in Free Air of the Induced Activity of Solid Bodies.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>A solid body, which has been excited by radium in an
enclosed space for a sufficient length of time, and which has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>then been removed from the enclosure, parts with its activity
in free air according to an exponential law, which is the
same for all bodies represented by the following formula:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/i_73a.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c030'>I<sub>0</sub> being the initial intensity of the radiation at the moment
of withdrawing the plate from the enclosure; I, the intensity
after time, <i>t</i>; <i>a</i> is a numerical coefficient, a = 4·20; θ<sub>1</sub>
and θ<sub>2</sub> are time constants, θ<sub>1</sub> = 2420 secs., θ<sub>2</sub> = 1860 secs.
After two or three hours this law becomes practically a
simple exponential, and the effect of the second exponential
upon the value of I is negligible. The law of dissipation is
therefore such that the intensity of radiation becomes
diminished to one-half its value in twenty-eight minutes.
This final law may be considered as characteristic for the
dissipation in an unconfined air space of the activity induced
in solid bodies by radium.</p>

<p class='c010'>Solid bodies excited by actinium lose their activity in the
open air, according to an exponential law similar to the
preceding, the dissipation being, however, rather slower.</p>

<p class='c010'>Solid bodies, made active by thorium, lose their activity
much more slowly; the intensity of the radiation is reduced
to one-half in eleven hours.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Dissipation of Activity in a Confined Space. Velocity of Destruction of the Emanation.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>An enclosure, made active by radium and then removed
from its influence, loses its activity by a law which is much
less rapid than that of dissipation in the open air. The
experiment may be carried out with a glass tube, rendered
active internally by placing it for some time in contact with
a solution of a salt of radium. The tube is then sealed in
the flame, and the intensity of radiation emitted by the walls
of the tube is measured while the dissipation takes place.</p>

<p class='c010'>The law of dissipation is an exponential law. It is given
very accurately by the formula.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/i_73b.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>I<sub>0</sub></dt>

    <dt>θ</dt>
    <dd>= a time constant, θ = 4·970 × 10<sup>5</sup> secs.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c010'>The intensity of the radiation is reduced to one-half in
four days.</p>

<p class='c010'>This law of dissipation is absolutely invariable whatever
be the experimental conditions (dimensions of enclosure,
nature of the walls, nature of the gas within the enclosure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>duration of action, &amp;c.). The law of dissipation remains
the same for any temperature between –180° and +450°.
The law is therefore altogether characteristic.</p>

<p class='c010'>In these experiments it is the radio-active energy
accumulated in the gas that maintains the activity of the
walls. If the gas be withdrawn and a vacuum caused in the
enclosure, we have found that dissipation of activity at once
occurs in the rapid method; the intensity of radiation being
reduced to one-half in twenty-eight minutes. The same
result is obtained when ordinary air is substituted for the
active air in the enclosure.</p>

<p class='c010'>The law of dissipation with reduction of intensity of
radiation to one-half in four days, is therefore characteristic
of the disappearance of radio-active energy accumulated in
the gas. By making use of the expression adopted by Mr.
Rutherford, the emanation from radium may be said to disappear
spontaneously as a function of the time, with reduction
to one-half in four days.</p>

<p class='c010'>The emanation from thorium is of another kind, and disappears
much more rapidly. The intensity of radiation
diminishes to one-half in about one minute ten seconds.</p>

<p class='c010'>The emanation from actinium disappears still more
rapidly; reduction to one-half takes place in a few seconds.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Variation of Activity of Liquids rendered Active and of Radium Solutions.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>Any liquid whatever becomes radio-active when placed in
an active confined space. On being removed and left freely
exposed to the air, the liquid rapidly loses its activity, imparting
it to the gas and solid bodies surrounding it. If a
liquid thus made active be placed in a closed flask, it loses
its activity much more slowly; the latter being reduced in
intensity to one-half in four days, just as would a gas under
similar circumstances. This fact may be explained by
assuming that the radio-active energy is stored in liquids in
exactly the same form as in gases (in the form of an emanation).</p>

<p class='c010'>A solution of a radium salt behaves in a somewhat
similar manner. At first, it is a remarkable fact that the
solution of a radium salt placed for some time in a confined
space is no more active than pure water placed in a vessel
in the same enclosure, when the equilibrium of activity is
established. If the radium solution be removed from the
enclosure and left standing in the air in a wide-necked
vessel, the activity spreads itself into space, and the solution
becomes nearly inactive, though still containing radium.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>If this solution be now enclosed in a stoppered flask, it
gradually regains, in about a fortnight, a maximum of
activity, which may be considerable. On the other hand, a
liquid made active, but not containing radium, does not regain
its activity in a closed flask after having been exposed
to the atmosphere.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Theory of Radio-activity.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The following is, according to MM. Curie and Debierne,
a very general theory which allows of the co-ordination of
the results of the investigation of induced radio-activity,
which results I have just stated, and which constitute facts
apart from any hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be said that each atom of radium acts as a constant
and continuous source of energy, without actually
defining the origin of this energy. The radio-active energy
which accumulates in the radium tends to become dissipated
in two different ways:—(1) By radiation (rays both charged
and uncharged with electricity); (2) by conduction, <i>i.e.</i>, by
gradual transmission to surrounding bodies in a medium of
gases and liquids (production of an emanation and transformation
into induced radio-activity).</p>

<p class='c010'>The loss of radio-active energy, both by radiation and by
conduction, increases with the amount of energy accumulated
in the radio-active body. The system is necessarily
in equilibrium when the double loss of which I have just
made mention compensates the constant gain due to the
action of radium. This manner of regarding the subject is
similar to that in use for calorific phenomena. If in the
interior of any body there is, owing to any cause, a continuous
and constant evolution of heat, the heat accumulates
in the body and the temperature rises until the loss of
heat by radiation and conduction is in equilibrium with the
constant gain of heat.</p>

<p class='c010'>In general, except under certain special circumstances,
the activity is not propagated through solid bodies. When
a solution is kept in a sealed tube, the loss by radiation
alone takes place, and the radiating activity of the solution
is of a higher degree.</p>

<p class='c010'>If, on the contrary, the solution stands in an open vessel,
the loss of activity by conduction becomes considerable,
and when the state of equilibrium is attained, the radiating
activity of the solution is very feeble.</p>

<p class='c010'>The radiating activity of a solid radium salt left exposed
to the air does not sensibly diminish, because the propagation
of activity by conduction not taking place through
solid bodies, it is a very thin superficial layer only that produces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>induced radio-activity. The solution, however, of the
same salt produces much more intense phenomena of
induced radio-activity. With a solid salt the radio-active
energy accumulates in the salt, and is dissipated chiefly by
radiation. On the other hand, when the salt has been for
several days in aqueous solution, the radio-active energy is
divided between the salt and the water, and if separated by
distillation the water carries with it a large portion of the
activity, and the solid salt is much less active (ten or fifteen
times) than before solution. Afterwards the solid salt
gradually regains its original activity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The preceding theory may be yet further defined by supposing
the radio-activity of radium itself to be produced
through the medium of the radio-active energy emitted in
the form of an emanation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Each atom of radium may be considered as a constant
and continuous source of emanation. At the same moment
that this form of energy is produced, it undergoes a progressive
transformation into radio-active energy of the
Becquerel radiation. The velocity of this transformation is
proportional to the quantity of the emanation accumulated.</p>

<p class='c010'>When a radium solution is placed within an enclosure,
the emanation is able to expand into the enclosure and to
spread out over the walls. Here it is, therefore, that it is
transformed into a radiation, the solution giving off but few
Becquerel rays; the radiation is, in some sort, <i>externalised</i>.
On the other hand, with solid radium, the emanation not
being able to escape readily, accumulates, and is transformed
into the Becquerel radiation on the spot; this radiation
therefore acquires a higher value.</p>

<p class='c010'>If this theory of radio-activity were general, we should
have to say that all radio-active bodies give rise to an
emanation. Now this emission has been confirmed in the
case of radium, thorium, and actinium; with the latter in
particular the emission is enormous, even in the solid state.
Uranium and polonium do not seem to emit any emanation,
though they generate Becquerel rays. These bodies produce
no induced radio-activity in an enclosed space, as do
the radio-active bodies mentioned before. This fact is not
in absolute contradiction to the preceding theory. If
uranium and polonium were to emit emanations which become
destroyed with very great rapidity, it would be very
difficult to observe the carriage of such emanations by the
air and the effects of induced radio-activity produced by
them upon neighbouring bodies. Such a hypothesis is not
improbable, since the times required for certain quantities of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the emanations of radium and thorium to diminish to one-half
are in the proportion of 5000 to 1. We shall see, moreover,
that, under certain conditions, uranium can excite
induced activity.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Another Form of Induced Radio-activity.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>According to the law of dissipation in the open air of the
activity induced by radium in solid bodies, the activity after
one day is almost imperceptible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Certain bodies, however, form exceptions; such are
celluloid, paraffin, caoutchouc, &amp;c. When these bodies
have been acted upon to a sufficient degree, they lose their
activity more slowly than the law can account for, and it is
often fifteen or twenty days before the activity becomes
imperceptible. These bodies appear to have the property of
becoming charged with radio-active energy in the form of an
emanation; they afterwards lose it gradually, causing induced
radio-activity in the vicinity.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Induced Radio-activity with Slow Dissipation.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>There is yet another form of induced radio-activity, which
appears to be produced in all bodies which have been kept
for months in an active enclosure. When these bodies are
removed from the enclosure their activity at first diminishes
to a very low value according to the ordinary law (diminution
to one-half in half-an-hour); but when the activity has
fallen to about 1/20,000 of the initial value, it diminishes no
further, or at least it is dissipated very slowly, sometimes
even increasing in amount. We have sheets of copper,
aluminium, and glass which still retain a residual activity
after six months.</p>

<p class='c010'>These phenomena of induced radio-activity appear to be
of a different kind from the ordinary ones, and show a much
slower process of evolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>A considerable time is also necessary both for the production
and dissipation of this form of induced radio-activity.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Radio-activity Induced upon Substances in Solution with Radium.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>When a radio-active ore containing radium is treated,
with the object of extracting the radium, chemical separations
are effected, after which the radio-activity is confined
entirely to one of the products. In this way active products,
which may be several hundred times as active as uranium,
are separated from totally inactive products, such as copper,
antimony, arsenic, &amp;c. Certain other bodies (iron, lead)
were never separated in an entirely inactive state. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>these active bodies are concentrated, the case is no longer
the same; each chemical separation no longer furnishes
absolutely inactive products; all the resulting products of a
separation are active in varying degrees.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the discovery of induced radio-activity, M. Giesel
was the first to attempt to excite activity in ordinary inactive
bismuth by keeping it in solution with very active
radium. He thus obtained radio-active bismuth, and from
this he concluded that the polonium extracted from pitchblende
was probably bismuth made active by the vicinity of
the radium contained in the pitchblende.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have also prepared active bismuth by keeping bismuth
in solution with a very active radium salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>The difficulties of this experiment consist in the extreme
precautions which must be taken to remove all traces of
radium from the solution. If we realise what an infinitesimal
quantity of radium suffices to produce very considerable
radio-activity in 1 grm. of material, it is difficult to
believe in the possibility of sufficiently washing and
purifying the active product. Each purification causes a
diminution of activity of the product, whether this be due to
removal of traces of radium or that the induced radio-activity
is, under these circumstances, not proof against chemical
reactions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The results I obtained appear, however, to establish with
certainty the fact that the activity is produced and persists
after the radium is removed. On fractionating the nitrate
of my active bismuth by precipitation with water from the
nitric acid solution, I found that after careful purifying it
fractionated like polonium, the most active portion being
precipitated first.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the purification is not complete the opposite occurs,
showing that traces of radium still remain. I thus obtained
active bismuth which from the manner of fractionation
showed great purity and which was 2000 times as active as
uranium. This bismuth diminishes in activity with lapse
of time. But another portion of the same product, prepared
with the same precautions, and fractionating in the same
manner, preserves its activity without diminution for
actually a period of about three years.</p>

<p class='c010'>This activity is 150 times as great as that of uranium.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have also prepared active lead and silver by leaving
them in solution with radium. Generally induced radio-activity
obtained in this way scarcely lessens with lapse of
time, but it does not as a rule withstand many successive
chemical changes of the active body.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>M. Debierne made active barium by placing it in solution
with actinium. This barium remains active after several
chemical reactions, its activity being therefore a somewhat
stable atomic property. Active barium chloride fractionates
like barium-radium chloride, the more active portions being
the least soluble in water and dilute hydrochloric acid.
The dry chloride is spontaneously luminous: its Becquerel
radiation is similar to that of barium-radium chloride. M.
Debierne has prepared an active barium chloride 1000 times
as active as uranium. This barium, however, had not
acquired all the characteristics of radium, for it showed none
of the strongest radium lines in the spectroscope. Further,
its activity diminished on standing, and after three weeks it
had become one-third of its original value.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a wide field for research upon the radio-activity
induced in substances in solution with active bodies. It
appears that, according to the conditions of experiment,
more or less stable forms of induced atomic radio-activity
may be obtained. The radio-activity induced under these
circumstances is perhaps identical with that form, which
dissipates slowly, obtained by prolonged exposure at a distance
in an active enclosure. We have reason to enquire
to what degree induced radio-activity affects the chemical
nature of the atom, and if it is able to modify the chemical
properties of the latter, either temporarily or permanently.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chemical investigation of bodies excited at a distance
is rendered difficult by the fact that the induced activity is
limited to a very thin superficial layer, and that, consequently,
only a very small proportion of the material has
been affected.</p>

<p class='c010'>Induced radio-activity also results from leaving certain
substances in solution with uranium. The experiment
succeeded in the case of barium. If, as was done by M.
Debierne, sulphuric acid be added to a solution containing
uranium and barium, the precipitate of barium sulphate
acquires radio-activity, and, at the same time, the uranium
salt loses part of its activity. M. Becquerel found, after
repeating this experiment several times, that almost inactive
uranium was obtained. This might lead to the opinion that
a radio-active body differing from uranium had been
separated from the latter, its presence producing radio-activity
in uranium. This, however, is not the case, for
after some months the uranium regains its original activity;
the precipitated barium sulphate, on the contrary, loses
what it acquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>A similar phenomenon is observed with thorium. Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Rutherford precipitated a solution of a salt of thorium with
ammonia; he separated off the solution and evaporated it
to dryness. He thus obtained a small very active residue,
and the precipitated thorium was observed to be less active
than before. This active residue, to which Mr. Rutherford
gives the name of <i>thorium</i> X, loses its activity after a time,
whilst the thorium regains its original activity.</p>

<p class='c010'>It appears, then, that concerning induced radio-activity
all bodies do not behave in a similar manner, and that
certain of them are much more readily excited than others.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Dissemination of Radio-active Particles and Induced Radio-activity of the Laboratory.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>In making investigations of strongly radio-active bodies,
particular precautions must be observed for obtaining
delicate determinations. The different objects used in the
chemical laboratory and those used for physical experiments
soon acquire radio-activity, and act upon photographic
plates through black paper. Dust particles, the air of the
room, clothing, all become radio-active. The air of the
room becomes a conductor. In our laboratory the evil has
become acute, and we no longer have any apparatus
properly insulated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Special precautions must therefore be taken to avoid as
much as possible the dissemination of active dust particles,
and to avoid also the phenomena of induced activity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The objects employed in chemistry should never be
brought into the room where physical research is carried on,
and as far as possible should be avoided any unnecessary
keeping of active substances in this room. Before beginning
our researches we were in the habit, in the case of
electrical experiments, of making a connection between the
different parts of the apparatus by insulated metallic wires,
protected by metal cylinders connected to earth, which
screened the wires from all outside electrical forces. In the
investigation of radio-active bodies this arrangement is quite
defective; the air being a conductor there is incomplete
insulation between the thread and the cylinder, and the
inevitable electromotive force of contact between the thread
and the cylinder tends to produce a current through the air,
and to cause a deflection of the electrometer. We now
screen all the wires from the air by placing them inside
cylinders filled with paraffin or other insulating material.
It would also be advantageous in these investigations to
make use of carefully enclosed electrometers.</p>

  <h3 class='c011'><i>Activity Induced Outside the Influence of Radio-active Substances.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Attempts were made to produce induced radio-activity
outside the action of radio-active bodies.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Villard subjected to the action of the cathode rays a
piece of bismuth placed as anticathode in a Crookes tube;
the bismuth was thus rendered active to a very slight
degree, for it required an exposure of eight days to obtain
a photographic impression.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. MacLennan has exposed different salts to the action
of cathode rays, afterwards warming them slightly. The
salts then acquired the property of neutralising bodies
positively charged.</p>

<p class='c010'>Studies of this kind are of great interest. If, by using
known physical agents, it were possible to create a considerable
radio-activity in bodies originally inactive, we
might hope thence to discover the cause of the spontaneous
radio-activity of certain substances.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Variations of Activity of Radio-active Bodies. Effects of Solution.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The activity of polonium, as I have said above, diminishes
with time. This diminution is slow, and does not take
place at the same rate with different specimens. A sample
of bismuth-polonium nitrate lost half its activity in eleven
months, and 95 per cent in thirty-three months. Other
specimens have evidenced similar diminution.</p>

<p class='c010'>A specimen of metallic bismuth containing polonium was
prepared from the nitrite, its activity after preparation being
100,000 times that of uranium. The metal is now only a
body of medium radio-activity (2000 times that of uranium).
Its radio-activity is determined at intervals. In six months
it has lost 67 per cent of its activity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The loss of activity does not seem to be facilitated by
chemical action. In rapid chemical changes no considerable
loss of activity has in general taken place.</p>

<p class='c010'>In contrast to that which occurs with polonium, radium
salts possess a permanent radio-activity which evidences no
appreciable diminution after many years.</p>

<p class='c010'>A freshly prepared radium salt in the solid state does not
at first possess an activity of constant strength. Its activity
increases from the time of preparation until it attains a
practically constant limiting value after about one month.
The opposite is the case for a solution. When freshly prepared
the solution is very active, but when left exposed to
the air it rapidly loses activity, and finally reaches a limiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>activity which may be considerably less than the original.
These variations of activity were first observed by M.
Giesel. They are easily accounted for by the emanation
theory. The diminution of the activity of the solution corresponds
to the loss of the emanation which escapes into
space; this diminution is much less when the solution is contained
in a sealed tube. A solution which has lost its activity
in air recovers a greater activity in a sealed tube. The time of
increase of the activity of the salt which, after solution, has
been recently obtained in the solid state, is that during which
the emanation is being newly stored in the solid radium.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following are some experiments on this subject:—</p>

<p class='c010'>A solution of barium-radium chloride left exposed to the
air for two days becomes 300 times less active.</p>

<p class='c010'>A solution is enclosed in a stoppered vessel; the vessel
is opened, the solution poured into a dish, and the activity
determined:—</p>

<p class='c010'>The initial activity of a solid salt after preparation is
feeble in proportion as the time of solution was long. A
greater proportion of activity is then transmitted to the
solvent. The following figures give the initial activity with
a chloride whose limiting activity is 800, and which was
kept for a given time in solution; the salt was afterwards
dried, and its activity immediately determined:—</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>During this experiment the dissolved salt was placed in a
vessel merely covered with a watch-glass.</p>

<p class='c010'>I made with the same salt two solutions which I kept in
sealed tubes for thirteen months; one of these solutions
was eight times the strength of the other:—</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>

    <td class='c022'>100</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'>The loss of activity of the salt is therefore greater when
the amount of solvent is greater, the radio-active energy
transmitted to the liquid having a greater volume of liquid
to saturate and a greater space to fill. The two specimens
of the same salt, which thus had a different initial activity,
further increased in activity at very different rates at first;
at the end of one day they had the same activity, and the
increase of activity now continued in the same manner for
both till the limit was reached.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the solution is dilute the loss of activity by the
salt is very rapid, as is shown by the following experiments:—Three
equal portions of the same radium salt are
dissolved in equal quantities of water. The first solution
(<i>a</i>) is allowed to stand in contact with the air for one hour,
and is then evaporated. The second solution (<i>b</i>) has a
current of air passed through it for one hour, and is then
evaporated. The third solution (<i>c</i>) is left exposed to the air
for thirteen days, and then evaporated to dryness. The
initial activity of each of the three salts is:—</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>For portion <i>a</i></td>
    <td class='c015'>145·2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>For portion <i>b</i></td>
    <td class='c015'>141·6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>For portion <i>c</i></td>
    <td class='c015'>102·6</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'>The limiting activity of the same salt is about 470. We
thus see that the greatest part of the effect was produced
at the end of one hour. Further, the air current bubbling
through solution <i>b</i> for one hour produced little effect. The
proportion of salt in solution was about 0·5 per cent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Radio-active energy in the form of an emanation is
propagated with difficulty from solid radium in air; it
experiences the same resistance to propagation from solid
radium in a liquid. When radium sulphate is shaken with
water for a whole day, its activity after the operation is
practically the same as that of a portion of the same sulphate
left exposed to air.</p>

<p class='c010'>On placing the radium salt in a vacuum, all the emanation
capable of displacement is withdrawn. However, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>radio-activity of a radium chloride kept <i>in vacuo</i> for six days
was not sensibly affected by the operation. This experiment
shows that the radio-activity of the salt is principally
due to the radio-active energy generated within the particles,
and which is unaffected by the vacuum.</p>

<p class='c010'>The loss of activity that radium undergoes when in solution
is relatively greater for the penetrating rays than for
the absorbable rays. The following are examples of this:—</p>

<p class='c010'>A radium chloride which had reached its limit of activity,
470, was dissolved and left in solution for one hour; it was
then evaporated, and its initial radio-activity determined by
the electrical method. The total initial radiation was
found to be equal to the fraction 0·3 of the total limiting
radiation. If the determination of the intensity of radiation
be made by covering the active body with an aluminium
screen 0·01 m.m. thick, the initial radiation which traverses
this screen is found to be only the fraction 0·17 of the limiting
radiation traversing the same screen.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the salt has been thirteen days in solution, the
total initial radiation is found to be the fraction 0·22 of the
total limiting radiation, and is 0·13 of the limiting radiation
after traversing 0·01 m.m. of aluminium.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the two cases the ratio of the initial radiation after
solution to the limiting radiation is 1·7 times as great for
the total radiation as for the radiation which has traversed
0·01 m.m. of aluminium.</p>

<p class='c010'>It must further be mentioned that on evaporating the
product after solution, it is impossible to avoid a certain
period of time during which the product is in an intermediate
condition, neither entirely solid nor entirely liquid. Neither
can one avoid warming the product to remove the water
quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>For these two reasons it is scarcely possible to determine
the true initial activity of the product passing from solution
to the solid state. In the experiments just quoted, equal
quantities of the active bodies were dissolved in the same
quantity of water, and the solutions were then evaporated
to dryness under conditions as identical as possible, and
without heating above 120° or 130°.</p>

<p class='c010'>I investigated the law according to which the activity of
a solid radium salt increases, from the moment in which the
salt is obtained dry after solution to the moment in which it
reaches its limit of activity. In the tables which follow,
the intensity of radiation, I, is represented as a function of
the time, the limiting intensity being supposed equal to 100,
and the time being reckoned from the moment at which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>product was dried. Table I. (Fig. 12, Curve I.) refers to
the total radiation. Table II. (Fig. 12, Curve II.) refers
only to the penetrating rays (rays which have traversed
3 c.m. of air and 0·01 m.m. of aluminium).</p>

<p class='c010'>I made several other series of determinations of the same
kind, but they do not absolutely agree with one another,
although the general character of the curves obtained remains
the same. It is difficult to obtain very regular
results. It may, however, be remarked that the acquisition
of activity requires more than one month for its production,
and that the most penetrating rays are the most deeply
affected by solution.</p>

<p class='c010'>The initial intensity of the radiation which is able to
traverse 3 c.m. of air and 0·01 m.m. of aluminium is only
1 per cent of the limiting intensity, whilst the initial intensity
of the total radiation is 21 per cent of the total limiting
radiation.</p>

<p class='c010'>A radium salt which has been dissolved and recently
evaporated to dryness possesses the same power of causing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>induced activity (and, consequently, of allowing the escape
of an emanation), as a specimen of the same salt which,
after having been prepared in the solid state, has remained
in this condition long enough to have attained its limiting
radio-activity. The radiant activity of these two products
is, however, quite different; the former is, for example, five
times less active than the latter.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Variations of the Activity of Radium Salts on Heating.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>When a radium compound is heated, it gives off an
emanation and loses activity. The more intense and the
more prolonged the heating, the greater is the loss of
activity. Thus, on heating a radium salt for one hour to
130°, it loses 10 per cent of its total radiation; on the other
hand, heating for ten minutes to 400° produces no apparent
effect. Heating to redness for several hours destroys 77 per
cent of the total radiation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The loss of activity on heating is more considerable for
the penetrating than for the absorbable rays. Thus, heating
for several hours destroys about 77 per cent of the total
radiation, but the same amount of heating destroys nearly
the whole (99 per cent) of the radiation that traverses 3 c.m.
of air and 0·01 m.m. of aluminium. If barium-radium chloride
be kept fused for several hours (towards 800°) 98 per cent
of the radiation capable of traversing 0·3 m.m. of aluminium
is destroyed. The penetrating rays may be considered as no
longer in existence after intense and prolonged heating.</p>

<p class='c010'>When a radium salt has lost part of its activity by heating,
the diminution is not lasting; the activity of the salt is
spontaneously regenerated at the ordinary temperature, and
approaches a certain limiting value. I have observed the
curious fact that this limit is higher than the limiting
activity of the salt before being heated—this, at least, is
the case with the chloride. I give examples of this:—A
specimen of barium-radium chloride which, after having
been prepared in the solid state, has long since attained its
limiting activity, possesses a total radiation represented by
the number 470, and a radiation capable of traversing 0·01
m.m. of aluminium, represented by the number 157. This,
specimen is heated to redness for several hours. Two
months after the heating it attains its limit of activity with
a total radiation equal to 690, and a radiation through
0·01 m.m. of aluminium, equal to 227. The total radiation
and the radiation transmitted by aluminium are therefore
increased respectively in the ratios <span class='fraction'>690<br /><span class='vincula'>470</span></span> and <span class='fraction'>227<br /><span class='vincula'>156</span></span>. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>two ratios are practically equal to one another, and are
equivalent to 1·45.</p>

<p class='c010'>A specimen of radium-barium chloride which, after having
been prepared in the solid state, has attained a limiting
activity of 62, is maintained in a state of fusion for some
hours; the fused product is then powdered. The product
regains a new limiting activity equal to 140, which is twice
as great as that to which it was able to attain when prepared
in the solid state without having been sensibly heated
during evaporation.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have investigated the law of increase of activity of
radium compounds after heating. The following are the
results of two series of determinations:—The figures of
Table I. and II. represent the intensity of the radiation (I)
as a function of time, the limiting intensity being supposed
equal to 100, and the time being reckoned from the close of
the heating. Table I. (Fig. 13, Curve I.) refers to the total
radiation of a specimen of barium-radium chloride. Table
II. (Fig. 13, Curve II.) relates to the penetrating radiation
of a specimen of barium-radium sulphate, the intensity of
the radiation which traversed 3 c.m. of air and 0·01 m.m. of
aluminium having been determined. The two products
were subjected to a bright red heat for seven hours.</p>

<p class='c010'>I made several other series of determinations, but the
results did not agree well.</p>

<p class='c010'>The effect of heating does not persist when the heated
radium compound is dissolved. Of two specimens of the
same radium compound of activity 1800, one was strongly
heated and its activity thereby reduced to 670. The two
portions being now dissolved and left in solution for twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>hours, their initial activities in the solid state were 460 for
the not heated portion and 420 for the heated one; the
difference between the two portions was therefore not considerable.
But if the two products do not remain for a
sufficient length of time in solution—if, for example, they
are evaporated to dryness, immediately after solution—the
not heated product is much more active than the heated
one; a certain time is necessary in the dissolved state for the
effects of heating to disappear. A product of activity 3200
was heated, and its activity thereby reduced to 1030. This
product and a similar portion which had not been heated
were simultaneously dissolved, and the two then immediately
evaporated to dryness. The initial activity was 1450
for the not heated portion, and 760 for the heated one.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the case of solid radium salts the capacity for exciting
induced radio-activity is largely affected by heating. During
heating radium compounds give off a larger amount of
emanation than at the ordinary temperature; but on being
cooled to the ordinary temperature, not only is their radio-activity
much less than before heating, but their capacity
for inducing activity is much diminished. During the time
that follows the heating, the radio-activity of the product
increases, and may even exceed the original value. The
induction capacity is also partially re-established; however,
after prolonged heating to redness, this capacity is almost
entirely destroyed without spontaneous re-appearance afterwards.
The induction capacity may be restored to the
radium salt by dissolving it in water, and drying it in the
oven at a temperature of 120°. This seems to have the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>effect of leaving the salt in a peculiar physical condition, in
which the emanation is given off with much less facility
than is the case with the same solid product not heated to
a high temperature, and it follows naturally that the salt
attains a higher limit of activity than that which it possessed
before heating. To transform the salts into the
physical condition proper to it before heating, it suffices to
dissolve it and to evaporate it to dryness without heating it
above 150°.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following are numerical examples of the above:—</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Theory of Interpretation of the Causes of Variations of Activity of Radium Salts after Solution and after Heating.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>The facts previously indicated may be in part explained
by the theory according to which the energy of radium is
produced in the form of an emanation, which is then transformed
into the energy of radiation. When a radium salt
is dissolved, the emanation produced by it spreads beyond
the solution, and causes radio-activity outside the source
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>from which it proceeds; when the solution is evaporated,
the solid salt obtained is but slightly active, because it contains
only a small amount of emanation. Gradually the
emanation is accumulated in the salt, the activity of which
rises to a limiting value, which is reached when the production
of the emanation by the radium compensates the
loss by external emission and by local transformation into
Becquerel rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>When a radium salt is heated, the external emission of
the emanation is greatly increased, and the phenomena of
induced radio-activity are more intense than when the salt
is at the ordinary temperature. But when the salt returns
to the ordinary temperature it is exhausted, as is the case
after being dissolved, and contains but a small amount of
emanation, its activity having become greatly reduced.
Gradually the emanation accumulates afresh in the solid
salt, and the radiation increases.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be said that radium gives rise to a constant
generation of any emanation—part of which escapes to the
exterior, the remainder being transformed in the radium
itself into Becquerel rays. When radium is raised to a red
heat, it loses the greater part of its capacity to cause the
induction of activity; otherwise stated, the evolution of the
emanation is lessened. Consequently, the proportion of
the emanation utilised in the radium itself should be greater,
and the substance attains a higher limit of radio-activity.</p>

<p class='c010'>We will endeavour to establish theoretically the law of
rise of activity of a solid radium salt which has been dissolved
or has been heated. We will assume that the intensity
of radiation of radium is, at each instant, proportional
to the quantity of emanation, <i>q</i>, present in the radium.
We know that the emanation is spontaneously destroyed
according to a law such that, at each instant—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id011'>
<img src='images/i_90a.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c030'><i>q</i><sub>0</sub> being the amount of the emanation at the moment of
starting the observation, and θ the time constant, equal to
4·97 × 10<sup>5</sup> secs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now let Δ be the evolution of the emanation by radium,
a quantity which I will assume constant. Let us consider
what would occur if no emanation were escaping to the exterior.
The emanation generated would then be completely
utilised by the radium for the production of the radiation.
We have from Formula 1—</p>
<div  class='figcenter id012'>
<img src='images/i_90b.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>and consequently, in the state of equilibrium, the radium
would contain a certain quantity of emanation, Q, such
that—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/i_91a.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c030'>and the radiation of the radium would then be proportional
to Q.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us suppose the radium placed in the circumstances
under which it gives off the emanation to the exterior; this
is obtained by dissolving the radium compound or by heating
it. The equilibrium will be disturbed, and the activity of
the radium diminished. But as soon as the cause of the
loss of emanation has been abolished (the body being restored
to the solid state or the heating having ceased), the
emanation is accumulated afresh in the radium and we have
a period during which the evolution, Δ, surpasses the
velocity of destruction, <i>q</i>/θ. We then have—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id014'>
<img src='images/i_91b.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c030'>from which—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(<i>d</i>/<i>dt</i>)(Q – <i>q</i>) = –(Q – <i>q</i>)/θ,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Q – <i>q</i> = (Q – <i>q</i><sub>0</sub>)e<sup>–<i>t</i>/θ</sup>      3,</div>
    </div>
  </div>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id016'>
<img src='images/i_91d.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c030'><i>q</i><sub>0</sub> being the amount of emanation present in the radium at
time <i>t</i> = 0.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to Formula 3, the excess of the quantity of
emanation, Q, contained by the radium in a state of equilibrium
above the quantity, <i>q</i>, contained at a given moment,
decreases as a function of the time according to an exponential
law, which is also the law of the spontaneous disappearance
of the emanation. The radiation of radium being
proportional to the amount of emanation, the excess of the
intensity of the limiting radiation above the actual intensity
should decrease as a function of the time by the same law;
the excess should thus diminish to one-half in about four days.</p>

<p class='c010'>The preceding theory is incomplete, since the loss of
emanation to the exterior has been neglected. It is also
difficult to determine the manner in which this acts as a
function of the time. In comparing the results of experiment
with those of this incomplete theory, there is found
to be no satisfactory agreement; the conviction is, however,
retained that the theory in question is partially true. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>law by which the excess of limiting activity above the actual
activity diminishes to one-half in four days represents
approximately the course of the renewal of activity after
heating for ten days. In the case of the renewal of activity
after solution, the same law appears to hold approximately
for a certain period of time, which begins two or three days
after evaporation to dryness and continues for ten or fifteen
days. The phenomena are otherwise complex; the theory
sketched out does not explain the reason of the suppression
of the penetrating rays in greater proportion than the absorbable
rays.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Nature and Cause of the Phenomena of Radio-activity.</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>From the beginning of research upon the radio-active
bodies, and when the properties of these bodies were yet
hardly known, the spontaneity of their radiation presented
itself as a problem having the greatest interest for physicists.
To-day we have advanced considerably in the understanding
of radio-active bodies, and are able to isolate one of very
great power, viz., radium. With the object of making use
of the remarkable properties of radium, a profound investigation
of the rays emitted by radio-active bodies is indispensable;
the various groups of rays under investigation
present points of similarity with the groups of rays existing
in Crookes tubes: cathode rays, Röntgen rays, canal rays.
The same groups of rays are found in the secondary radiation
produced by Röntgen rays, and in the radiation of
bodies which have acquired radio-activity by induction.</p>

<p class='c010'>But if the nature of the radiation is actually better known,
the cause of this spontaneous radiation remains a mystery,
and the phenomena always presents itself to us as a profound
and wonderful enigma.</p>

<p class='c010'>The spontaneously radio-active bodies, and in the first
place radium, are sources of energy. The evolution of
energy, to which they give rise, is manifested by Becquerel
radiation, by chemical and luminous effects, and by the continuous
generation of heat.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question often arises as to whether energy is created
within the radio-active bodies themselves, or whether it is
borrowed by them from external sources. No one of the
numerous hypotheses arising from these two points of view
has yet received experimental confirmation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The radio-active energy may be assumed to have been
initially accumulated and then gradually dissipated, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>happens in the case of long continued phosphorescence.
We imagine the evolution of radio-active energy to correspond
to a transformation of the nature of the atom of
the active body; the fact of the continuous generation of
heat by radium speaks in favour of this hypothesis. The
transformation may be assumed to be accompanied by a
loss of weight and by an emission of material particles constituting
the radiation. The source of energy may yet be
sought in the energy of gravitation. Finally, we may
imagine that space is constantly traversed by radiations yet
unknown, which are arrested in their course by radio-active
bodies and transformed into radio-active energy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many reasons are adduced for and against these different
views, and most often attempts at experimental verifications
of the conclusions drawn from these hypotheses have given
negative results. The radio-active energy of uranium and
radium apparently neither becomes exhausted nor varies
appreciably with lapse of time. Demarçay examined spectroscopically
a specimen of pure radium chloride after a five
months’ interval, and observed no change in the spectrum.
The principal barium line, which was visible in the spectrum
indicating the presence of a trace of barium, had not increased
in intensity during the interval, showing therefore
that there was no transformation of radium into barium to
an appreciable extent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The variations of weight announced by M. Heydweiller
in radium compounds cannot yet be looked upon as established
facts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elster and Geitel found that the radio-activity of uranium
is not affected at the bottom of a mine-shaft 850 m. deep;
a layer of earth of this thickness would therefore not affect
the hypothetical primary radiation which would be excited
by the radio-activity of uranium.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have determined the radio-activity of uranium at
midday and at midnight, thinking that if the hypothetical
primary radiation had its origin in the sun it would be
partly absorbed in traversing the earth. The experiment
showed no difference in the two determinations.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Conclusions.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>I will define, in conclusion, the part I have personally
taken in the researches upon radio-active bodies.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have investigated the radio-activity of uranium compounds.
I have examined other bodies for the existence of
radio-activity, and found the property to be possessed by
thorium compounds. I have made clear the atomic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>character of the radio-activity of the compounds of uranium
and thorium.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have conducted a research upon radio-active substances
other than uranium and thorium. To this end I investigated
a large number of substances by an accurate electrometric
method, and I discovered that certain minerals
possess activity which is not to be accounted for by their
content of uranium and thorium.</p>

<p class='c010'>From this I concluded that these minerals must contain
a radio-active body different from uranium and thorium,
and more strongly radio-active than the latter metals.</p>

<p class='c010'>In conjunction with M. Curie, and subsequently with
MM. Curie and Bémont, I was able to extract from pitchblende
two strongly radio-active bodies—polonium and
radium.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have been continuously engaged upon the chemical examination
and preparation of these substances. I effected
the fractionations necessary to the concentration of radium,
and I succeeded in isolating pure radium chloride. Concurrently
with this work, I made several atomic weight
determinations with a very small quantity of material, and
was finally able to determine the atomic weight of radium
with a very fair degree of accuracy. The work has proved
<i>that radium is a new chemical element</i>. Thus the new
method of investigating new chemical elements, established
by M. Curie and myself, based upon radio-activity, is fully
justified.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have investigated the law of absorption of polonium
rays, and of the absorbable rays of radium, and have demonstrated
that this law of absorption is peculiar and
different from the known laws of other radiations.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have investigated the variation of activity of radium
salts, the effect of solution and of heating, and the renewal
of activity with time, after solution or after heating.</p>

<p class='c010'>In conjunction with M. Curie, I have examined different
effects produced by the new radio-active substances (electric,
photographic, fluorescent, luminous colourations, &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c010'>In conjunction with M. Curie, I have established the fact
that radium gives rise to rays charged with negative electricity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our researches upon the new radio-active bodies have
given rise to a scientific movement, and have been the
starting-point of numerous researches in connection with
new radio-active substances, and with the investigation of
the radiation of the known radio-active bodies.</p>
